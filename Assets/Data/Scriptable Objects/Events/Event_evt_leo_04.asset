  title: Your AI Our Product
  bodyText: "Our product is based entirely on your AI. When a user clicks a button,
    your model runs. On your servers. We didn\u2019t build a fallback system. We
    can\u2019t afford one. So every user we gain is a direct cost - and risk - for
    you. If we charge users enough to cover that, we don\u2019t grow."
  choiceA:
    label: Carry the infrastructure burden
    flavor: We fuel ecosystem growth.
    effects: innovation:2|industry:-1
    result: "The product scales fast \u2014 on your AI. Your costs rise faster than
      your revenue."
  choiceB:
    label: Force Leo to internalize the costs
    flavor: "Our AI isn\u2019t free infrastructure."
    effects: industry:2|innovation:-1
    result: "Your financial exposure stays controlled. Leo\u2019s product growth
      stalls or migrates elsewhere."
