  title: Your AI Our Product
  bodyText: "Our product is based entirely on your AI. When a user clicks a button,
    your model runs. On your servers. We didn\u2019t build a fallback system. We
    can\u2019t afford one. So every user we gain is a direct cost - and risk - for
    you. If we charge users enough to cover that, we don\u2019t grow."
