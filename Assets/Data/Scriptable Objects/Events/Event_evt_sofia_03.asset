  title: Synthetic Voices
  bodyText: In that video - it sounds like a famous actor. Your AI can generate voices
    that are indistinguishable. Legality is unclear. Ethics even more so. This can
    be a story about democratized creativity - or about consent disappearing.
  choiceA:
    label: Restrict voice models to licensed use
    flavor: We require explicit permission.
    outcome: Consent becomes the headline. Creative experimentation narrows.
    effects:
      industry: 0
      civilSociety: 1
      governance: 2
      innovation: -2
  choiceB:
    label: Allow open voice synthesis
    flavor: We trust users.
    outcome: New uses explode. So do uncomfortable questions.
    effects:
      industry: 0
      civilSociety: -1
      governance: -1
