  title: XR Authority
  bodyText: "Inside XR, the AI highlights objects, people, options - before you even
    ask. \"The system doesn\u2019t just answer. It guides attention. Gestures. Timing.
    Users follow it instinctively.\""
  choiceA:
    label: Deploy XR as a core interface
    flavor: This is the future.
    outcomeTitle: Adoption soars. Users defer to the system more than intended.
    outcomeText: "XR becomes the primary way users interact with the system. Information,
      options, and cues are placed directly into their field of view, making guidance
      feel immediate and natural. Engagement and adoption climb rapidly. At the same
      time, users begin to follow the system\u2019s prompts more automatically, as
      the interface quietly shapes what feels like a reasonable choice."

  choiceB:
    label: Restrict XR to experimental use
    flavor: We keep it optional.
    outcomeTitle: The tech matures slowly. The sense of AI authority is contained.
    outcomeText: "XR remains a controlled, opt-in layer rather than the default interface.
      Developers continue to refine how much influence the system should have over
      attention and behavior. Growth is slower, but the technology\u2019s impact
      on user decision-making stays easier to observe and manage. Exploration continues,
      while authority is kept in check."
