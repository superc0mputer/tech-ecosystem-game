  title: Unequal Service
  bodyText: "Luis puts a printed dashboard on the table. \"This AI sorts incoming
    requests for City Hall. In the city center, requests are answered within hours.
    In the outer districts, people wait days. The second area is already angry at
    City Hall. They think we\u2019re ignoring them.\""
  choiceA:
    label: Fix fairness citywide
    flavor: We rebalance priorities.
    outcomeTitle: Response times become more equal. Overall processing slows down.
    outcomeText: The prioritization system is adjusted to balance response times
      across all districts. Service becomes more even, reducing visible disparities
      between neighborhoods. High-demand areas see some delays as capacity is redistributed.
      Equity improves, while overall throughput drops.
    effects:
      industry: -1

      governance: 0
      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Optimize where it already works
    flavor: Efficiency wins.
    outcomeTitle: Central districts stay fast. Anger grows elsewhere.
    outcomeText: Resources remain concentrated in districts where the system performs
      best. Central areas continue to receive rapid responses, keeping headline metrics
      strong. Outer districts wait longer, and dissatisfaction deepens. Efficiency
      holds, even as political and social pressure builds in neglected areas.
