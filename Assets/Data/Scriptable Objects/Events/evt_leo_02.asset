  title: "I\u2019ll Move Anyway"
  bodyText: "If you slow me down. I\u2019ll build on someone else\u2019s stack. I\u2019d
    rather build on yours. But speed decides loyalty. You can block me - or shape
    what I become."
  choiceA:
    label: Keep Leo inside your ecosystem
    flavor: We influence from within.
    outcomeTitle: You retain indirect influence. You inherit downstream risk.
    outcomeText: Leo continues building on your system, adapting his product to its
      strengths and constraints. This preserves a degree of influence over how his
      technology evolves, even as his success increases reliance on your infrastructure.
      As his startup grows, so does the impact of his decisions on your reputation.
      Influence remains, while responsibility for downstream outcomes becomes harder
      to separate.

  choiceB:
    label: Cut him off early
    flavor: We draw clear boundaries.
    outcomeTitle: Your exposure drops. An uncontrolled competitor emerges.
    outcomeText: "Access is withdrawn before deeper dependencies form. Your direct
      exposure to Leo\u2019s choices decreases, and formal responsibility ends at
      the boundary you enforce. Leo pursues alternative platforms, shaping his product
      without your constraints or insight. Risk moves outward, even as competition
      and uncertainty increase beyond your control."
