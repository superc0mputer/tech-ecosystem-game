  title: Targeted Visibility
  bodyText: Our AI sends city notifications. Deadlines, service updates, reminders.
    It started prioritizing districts with low engagement. Turnout improves there.
    No one tells people who to vote for. But the timing helps me.
  choiceA:
    label: Standardize communication citywide
    flavor: We make it strictly neutral.
    effects: governance:2|civil_society:2|industry:-1
    result: Messaging becomes neutral. Political advantages flatten out.
  choiceB:
    label: Keep optimizing engagement
    flavor: "It\u2019s still public service."
    effects: industry:2|governance:-1|civil_society:-1
    result: Engagement rises where it matters. So do questions about fairness.
