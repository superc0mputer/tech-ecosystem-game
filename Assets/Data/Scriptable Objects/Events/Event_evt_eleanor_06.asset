  title: Who Gets to Build on You
  bodyText: "Your platform is becoming foundational, not just a product - something
    others depend on. You can keep it expensive, tightly controlled, and optimized
    for large clients. Or you can lower barriers so smaller actors - nonprofits,
    startups, public-interest groups - can build on it too, but you have to accept
    less oversight over how it\u2019s used."
  choiceA:
    label: Keep access limited and controlled
    flavor: We approve who builds on the system.
    effects: industry:1|governance:2|civil_society:1|innovation:-1
    result: Use cases stay traceable and enforceable. Fewer actors shape the ecosystem.
  choiceB:
    label: Broaden access deliberately
    flavor: We lower barriers and accept less control.
    effects: civil_society:3|innovation:1|industry:-1
    result: More groups benefit from the technology. Misuse becomes harder to anticipate
      and correct.
