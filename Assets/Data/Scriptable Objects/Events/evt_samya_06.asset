  title: The Breakthrough
  bodyText: "We cracked it. The model generalizes better than anything we\u2019ve
    built. It\u2019s not just bigger. It\u2019s\u2026 different. But\u2026 I can\u2019t
    fully explain why it works yet. But if we wait, someone else will ship first."
  choiceA:
    label: Ship the breakthrough immediately
    flavor: We take the lead.
    outcomeTitle: You leap ahead of competitors. Understanding lags behind deployment.
    outcomeText: The new model is released while its performance still outpaces any
      clear explanation. Your company pulls ahead in capability and market position,
      setting a new benchmark for the field. At the same time, engineers and regulators
      are left to study a system already in use. Leadership grows, while understanding
      struggles to keep up.

  choiceB:
    label: "Freeze deployment until it\u2019s understood"
    flavor: "We don\u2019t ship black magic."
    outcomeTitle: The system becomes legible and safer. Market momentum slows.
    outcomeText: The breakthrough is held back while researchers work to map its
      behavior and limits. Risks and failure modes become clearer before users ever
      touch it. Competitors move faster in the meantime, and the window for easy
      dominance narrows. Confidence increases, even as momentum slips.
