  title: Who Gets Support First?
  bodyText: "Your helpdesk is overwhelmed. Not everywhere but in some regions. Bug
    reports come in faster than they can be handled. Some are clear. But a lot of
    them are vague and are written in broken English. So your support engineers are
    triaging them. They don\u2019t mean to. But they answer the tickets they understand
    fastest. Over time, that decides where the system actually works."
  choiceA:
    label: Prioritize equal support effort
    flavor: "Response time shouldn\u2019t depend on how well someone writes a ticket."
    outcomeTitle: Difficult contexts stabilize. Overall metrics drop.
    outcomeText: Support cases take longer to resolve and your engineers spend more
      time clarifying issues. But in regions where problems used to stall silently,
      fixes start to appear. On the other hand overall performance metrics drop slightly.
      All in all the system becomes more reliable in difficult contexts, but less
      responsive where expectations were already high.

  choiceB:
    label: Optimize for efficiency in support
    flavor: We fix what we can fix fastest.
    outcomeTitle: Throughput improves. Complex problems linger.
    outcomeText: The support throughput improves and metrics recover. The issues
      which are reported clearly and completely are resolved quickly, and those regions
      continue to see steady improvements. But in places where problems are harder
      to communicate, they remain unresolved for longer.
