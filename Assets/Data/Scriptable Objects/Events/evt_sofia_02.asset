  title: The Cheap Content Wave
  bodyText: "Sofia forwards you drafts she didn\u2019t write herself. \"That\u2019s
    the draft for my next article: Studios are cutting freelance budgets. Not with
    layoffs. Just\u2026 fewer calls. They\u2019re using AI for drafts, concepts,
    sometimes finals. Just for efficiency. How do you want this written?\""
  choiceA:
    label: Emphasize AI as a support tool
    flavor: We talk augmentation, not replacement.
    outcomeTitle: The narrative softens. The market keeps cutting costs anyway.
    outcomeText: The narrative reassures writers and artists that their work still
      matters, easing public and professional anxiety. Trust in the technology stabilizes,
      even as studios move more cautiously under increased scrutiny. Cost-cutting
      continues, but with more resistance and slower adoption. Social legitimacy
      grows, while short-term efficiency gains are limited.

      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Frame it as inevitable efficiency
    flavor: "We don\u2019t fight the trend."
    outcomeTitle: The story sounds realistic. Creative work looks increasingly disposable.
    outcomeText: Coverage aligns with how companies already talk about cost and output.
      The shift toward automated content feels unavoidable and rational. For creatives,
      the narrative offers little room for negotiation, as reduced budgets become
      framed as progress rather than choice. The market moves faster, while individual
      careers become easier to cut.
