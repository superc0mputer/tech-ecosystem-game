  title: Designing for the Most Affected
  bodyText: "Your system optimizes for average users. But harm isn\u2019t evenly
    distributed. A small group bears most of the downside: young users, people in
    crisis, users with limited alternatives. You can keep optimizing for the majority.
    Or you can redesign around the worst outcomes. You won\u2019t be able to do both."
  choiceA:
    label: Optimize for worst-case impact
    flavor: We design for those at greatest risk.
    outcome: Severe harms decrease. Overall performance and growth slow.
    effects:
      industry: -1
      civilSociety: 3
      governance: 1
      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Optimize for average performance
    flavor: We design for scale.
    outcome: The system remains competitive. Outliers continue to absorb the cost.
    effects:
      industry: 2
      civilSociety: -2
      governance: 0
