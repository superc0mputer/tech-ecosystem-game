  title: Neutrality
  bodyText: "Your AI isn\u2019t built for repression. But governments want it for
    classification and prediction. If I restrict lawful use, I\u2019m accused of
    ideology. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019m told I enabled abuse. Neutrality sounds simple.
    In practice, it\u2019s a decision too."
  choiceA:
    label: Limit certain government uses
    flavor: We draw ethical lines.
    outcomeTitle: Misuse risk drops. Political backlash follows.
    outcomeText: Specific applications are restricted, reducing the risk that the
      system is used for repression or mass surveillance. Your company becomes more
      defensible in regulatory and public scrutiny, but some governments push back
      or take their business elsewhere. Political tension increases, while boundaries
      around acceptable use become clearer.

  choiceB:
    label: Remain use-neutral
    flavor: We regulate legality, not intent.
    outcomeTitle: Markets stay open. Responsibility diffuses.
    outcomeText: Your system remains available to a wide range of government clients
      under formal legal frameworks. Market access expands, even as how the technology
      is applied varies widely. Oversight shifts away from your company and into
      fragmented national processes. Revenue grows, while accountability becomes
      harder to locate.
