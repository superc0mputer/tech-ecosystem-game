  title: Member States Disagree
  bodyText: Some countries want stricter enforcement. Others fear losing competitiveness.
    Your company is being cited by both sides. How visible do you want to be in this
    debate?
  choiceA:
    label: Support strong unified EU standards
    flavor: We back consistency.
    outcomeTitle: Regulatory clarity improves. Some markets cool.
    outcomeText: A single regulatory framework begins to take shape, reducing uncertainty
      across borders. Compliance becomes easier to plan, even as some regions move
      more cautiously under tighter rules. Your position makes the company a reference
      point in the debate. Clarity increases, while short-term market expansion slows.

  choiceB:
    label: Quietly lobby for flexibility
    flavor: We need room to adapt.
    outcomeTitle: National differences persist. Policy coherence weakens.
    outcomeText: Different national approaches continue to coexist, allowing the
      company to operate more freely in permissive markets. Policy remains fragmented,
      shaped by ongoing negotiation rather than shared standards. Opportunities stay
      open, even as long-term coherence becomes harder to achieve.
