  title: The Innovation Flight
  bodyText: "Three major AI labs are moving core R&D out of Europe. They\u2019ll
    still sell here. But training decisions, safety trade-offs, and breakthroughs
    will happen under other legal systems. If I ease conditions, I\u2019m accused
    of weakening the law. If I don\u2019t, Europe becomes a rule-taker for technologies
    it no longer shapes.I can\u2019t regulate what I don\u2019t host."
  choiceA:
    label: Move frontier research outside the EU
    flavor: We optimize for speed and leave the EU.
    outcomeTitle: Research accelerates under looser constraints. European rules apply
      only after development.
    outcomeText: Core research shifts to jurisdictions with fewer constraints, allowing
      faster experimentation and iteration. Your company remains competitive at the
      cutting edge, even as EU rules apply only to finished products. Europe continues
      to use the technology, but has less influence over how it is designed. Speed
      increases, while democratic oversight moves further downstream.

  choiceB:
    label: Keep frontier research in Europe
    flavor: We build under stricter standards.
    outcomeTitle: Development remains transparent and accountable. Breakthroughs
      take longer to reach scale.
    outcomeText: Frontier development stays under European regulatory and public
      scrutiny. Safety, labor, and accountability requirements shape what is built
      from the start. Progress is slower, but more legible to institutions and the
      public. Europe retains influence over design choices, even as breakthroughs
      arrive later and with less market momentum.
