  title: Designing for the Most Affected
  bodyText: "Your system optimizes for average users. But harm isn\u2019t evenly
    distributed. A small group bears most of the downside: young users, people in
    crisis, users with limited alternatives. You can keep optimizing for the majority.
    Or you can redesign around the worst outcomes. You won\u2019t be able to do both."
  choiceA:
    label: Optimize for worst-case impact
    flavor: We design for those at greatest risk.
    outcomeTitle: Severe harms decrease. Overall performance and growth slow.
    outcomeText: Design choices begin to prioritize scenarios where the system causes
      the most damage, even if they affect a small fraction of users. Safeguards,
      limits, and slower feedback loops reduce the severity of failures for those
      most exposed. The experience becomes more cautious and less optimized for speed
      or engagement. Extreme outcomes become rarer, while average performance becomes
      less aggressive.

  choiceB:
    label: Optimize for average performance
    flavor: We design for scale.
    outcomeTitle: The system remains competitive. Outliers continue to absorb the
      cost.
    outcomeText: The system continues to improve for the majority of users, reinforcing
      smooth interactions and strong growth metrics. Design decisions are guided
      by typical usage rather than rare but severe cases. Most users benefit from
      increased efficiency, while those at the margins experience the full force
      of failures. Performance remains high, even as some costs are carried by a
      few.
