  bodyText: "This is from an active case. A citizen is suing a public agency over
    an automated decision. These are your system logs. These logs are accurate, but
    they\u2019re written for machines - not for courts. If no one can explain them,
    they\u2019re not evidence. They\u2019re noise."
