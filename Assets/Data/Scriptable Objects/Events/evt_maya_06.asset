  title: Terms and Conditions
  bodyText: "Legal proposes an update. A new clause clearly states that users are
    fully responsible for decisions made with AI assistance. Maya reads it and sighs:
    \"So\u2026 it helps me decide. But only until something goes wrong.\""
  choiceA:
    label: Clarify and limit liability
    flavor: We protect the user too.
    outcomeTitle: Trust stabilizes. Your lawyers start sleeping less.
    outcomeText: The terms are rewritten to specify when the system can be relied
      on and where its responsibility ends. Some use cases become harder to offer,
      but disputes are easier to resolve. Users gain clearer expectations, even as
      legal complexity increases behind the scenes. Trust grows slowly, while operational
      flexibility narrows.
    effects:
      industry: -1

      governance: 3
      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Add the clause
    flavor: We protect the company.
    outcomeTitle: "Risk shifts downward. Users notice \u2014 eventually."
    outcomeText: The clause places responsibility squarely on the user, allowing
      the system to be used across a wider range of decisions. Adoption continues
      with minimal friction, as legal risk is pushed outward. Over time, users begin
      to recognize the imbalance between influence and liability. Efficiency remains
      high, even as confidence in the fairness of the arrangement erodes.
