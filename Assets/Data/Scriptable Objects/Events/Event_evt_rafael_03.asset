  title: The Supplier Question
  bodyText: Some of our critical components come from high-risk supply chains. Rare
    earths. Specialty chips. Cooling materials. Subcontractors flagged for unsafe
    labor conditions and forced overtime. We can switch to audited suppliers. But
    it will cost more.
  choiceA:
    label: Source from audited ethical suppliers
    flavor: We pay the premium.
    outcome: Supply chains become cleaner. Expansion slows and costs rise.
    effects:
      industry: -1
      civilSociety: 0
      governance: 2
      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Stick with current suppliers
    flavor: We follow the market.
    outcome: Hardware stays cheap. Ethical risk remains embedded.
    effects:
      industry: 2
