  title: Who Gets Priority?
  bodyText: "When capacity is tight, we prioritize workload. Right now, it\u2019s
    whoever pays most. We could reserve capacity for public or safety-critical uses.
    Or keep it purely commercial."
  choiceA:
    label: Reserve capacity for critical uses
    flavor: We limit peak profits.
    outcomeTitle: Essential services remain stable. Revenue opportunities shrink.
    outcomeText: A portion of compute is set aside for emergency services, public
      infrastructure, and safety-critical workloads. Those users remain reliable
      even during demand spikes. Commercial customers face occasional delays or higher
      prices as capacity is constrained. Social value is protected, while peak revenue
      potential declines.
    effects:
      industry: -1
      civilSociety: 1
      governance: 1
      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Keep purely commercial prioritization
    flavor: We follow the market.
    outcomeTitle: Revenue is maximized. Access becomes uneven.
    outcomeText: Compute is allocated through pricing, keeping utilization high and
      revenue predictable, which supports ongoing investment in infrastructure. High-paying
      clients receive consistent performance for demanding workloads. When capacity
      tightens, public and smaller users are pushed aside. Market efficiency increases,
      while access becomes increasingly unequal.

      industry: 2

      governance: -1
      innovation: 0
