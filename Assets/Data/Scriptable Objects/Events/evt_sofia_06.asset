  title: Did You Write This?
  bodyText: "Schools are panicking. Teachers can\u2019t tell what\u2019s human anymore.
    Detection doesn\u2019t work. Students are being accused. Some unfairly. Some
    correctly. This isn\u2019t about cheating. It\u2019s about whether your product
    becomes part of assessment - or something institutions actively try to block."
  choiceA:
    label: Make the product incompatible with exams
    flavor: We deliberately block use in exams.
    outcomeTitle: Institutions stop treating your AI as an assessment threat. Students
      continue using it outside formal evaluation.
    outcomeText: Schools regain a clear standard for what counts as unaided work,
      even though some students continue to use AI covertly. Disputes are framed
      as rule-breaking rather than system design. The product remains widely used
      for study, but not officially for proof of ability. Boundaries become clearer,
      even if they are not perfectly enforceable.

  choiceB:
    label: Make the product compatible with assessment
    flavor: We design features for grading.
    outcomeTitle: Adoption accelerates in education. Traditional notions of authorship
      erode.
    outcomeText: AI use becomes normalized in graded work, reducing the need for
      detection and enforcement. Students still differ in how they use it, but those
      with better access and skill gain a measurable edge. Assessment shifts from
      verifying authorship to managing assisted performance. The system fits institutions,
      even as what counts as individual achievement becomes harder to define.
