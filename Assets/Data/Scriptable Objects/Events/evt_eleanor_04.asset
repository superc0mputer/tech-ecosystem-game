  title: Who You Can Sell To Later
  bodyText: Not every potential buyer of your company wants the same kind of company.
    Some want fast growth and clean metrics. Others want stability and predictable
    risk. The way you structure responsibility now decides who will even look at
    you later.
  choiceA:
    label: Structure for clean exits
    flavor: We keep the company easy to sell.
    outcomeTitle: More buyers stay interested. Responsibility is kept deliberately
      narrow.
    outcomeText: Your company is organized around clear boundaries and transferable
      assets. Metrics are easy to compare, and responsibilities are defined narrowly
      to reduce perceived risk. A wider range of potential buyers remains interested,
      each able to project their own plans onto the company. Flexibility at the point
      of sale increases, while deeper accountability is deferred.

  choiceB:
    label: Structure for long-term ownership
    flavor: We accept complexity.
    outcomeTitle: Fewer buyers qualify. Those who remain stay longer.
    outcomeText: Responsibilities are distributed across longer time horizons, making
      the company harder to evaluate but easier to operate sustainably. Some buyers
      lose interest as risk becomes harder to isolate. Those who remain engage more
      deeply, prepared to inherit both capabilities and obligations. The pool narrows,
      but alignment increases.

      innovation: 0
