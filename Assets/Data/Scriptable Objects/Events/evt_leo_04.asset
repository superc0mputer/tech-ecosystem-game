  title: Your AI Our Product
  bodyText: "Our product is based entirely on your AI. When a user clicks a button,
    your model runs. On your servers. We didn\u2019t build a fallback system. We
    can\u2019t afford one. So every user we gain is a direct cost - and risk - for
    you. If we charge users enough to cover that, we don\u2019t grow."
  choiceA:
    label: Carry the infrastructure burden
    flavor: We fuel ecosystem growth.
    outcomeTitle: "The product scales fast \u2014 on your AI. Your costs rise faster
      than your revenue."
    outcomeText: "Leo\u2019s product scales quickly, tightly coupled to your infrastructure
      and performance. Adoption accelerates, showcasing the system\u2019s potential
      as a foundation for others. At the same time, operational costs rise faster
      than direct returns, and financial exposure grows with every additional user."

  choiceB:
    label: Force Leo to internalize the costs
    flavor: "Our AI isn\u2019t free infrastructure."
    outcomeTitle: "Your financial exposure stays controlled. Leo\u2019s product growth
      stalls or migrates elsewhere."
    outcomeText: Cost boundaries are made explicit, and usage becomes financially
      predictable. Leo is forced to slow growth, raise prices, or seek alternatives
      that shift the burden elsewhere. Your exposure remains contained, but so does
      your influence over how his product evolves.
