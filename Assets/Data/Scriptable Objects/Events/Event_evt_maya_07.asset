  title: Critical Use Case
  bodyText: "I work night shifts at a hospital. The AI helps us decide who gets a
    bed when it\u2019s full. Last night, it flagged a patient as low priority. I
    hesitated - then followed it. The patient died a few hours later. The report
    says I made the decision."
  choiceA:
    label: Restrict AI use in life-critical decisions
    flavor: "This can\u2019t happen again."
    effects: civil_society:3|governance:1|industry:-1
    result: "Hospitals slow down. Human responsibility is clear \u2014 and costly."
  choiceB:
    label: Keep AI use, add disclaimers
    flavor: The AI only advises.
    effects: industry:2|civil_society:-2
    result: Systems keep running smoothly. Trust erodes where the stakes are highest.
