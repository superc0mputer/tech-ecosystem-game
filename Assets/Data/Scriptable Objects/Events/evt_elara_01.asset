  title: XR Fatigue
  bodyText: "Users report dizziness and exhaustion after long XR sessions. They still
    log in every day. But they don\u2019t feel good."
  choiceA:
    label: Reduce XR intensity
    flavor: We design for comfort.
    outcomeTitle: Sessions shorten. Well-being improves.
    outcomeText: Usage sessions become shorter and more deliberate. The system nudges
      users to pause, reflect, or take breaks. Some workflows slow down, but people
      report feeling more in control of their thinking. Engagement drops slightly,
      while well-being improves.

  choiceB:
    label: Optimize for engagement
    flavor: Retention matters.
    outcomeTitle: Time-on-platform stays high. So does fatigue.
    outcomeText: The AI remains always-on, offering constant suggestions and support.
      Users stay productive and connected for longer stretches. Over time, reliance
      deepens, and independent judgment weakens. Efficiency holds, while cognitive
      fatigue quietly grows.
