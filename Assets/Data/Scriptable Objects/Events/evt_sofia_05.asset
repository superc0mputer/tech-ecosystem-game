  title: The Face Everyone Recognizes
  bodyText: "This one\u2019s bad. A deepfake. Sexual. Degrading. A real person. Not
    famous. Some persons lost their jobs. But the videos aren\u2019t illegal everywhere.
    This isn\u2019t about tools anymore. It\u2019s about responsibility."
  choiceA:
    label: Take responsibility publicly
    flavor: We act, even if it costs us.
    outcomeTitle: Abuse drops sharply. Your platform is no longer framed as neutral
      infrastructure.
    outcomeText: Your company intervenes through takedowns, model restrictions, and
      visible cooperation with platforms and investigators. Distribution of similar
      material declines as access points narrow. At the same time, the system is
      no longer seen as neutral infrastructure, but as an actor that can be held
      to account. Abuse decreases, while expectations of oversight and liability
      rise.

  choiceB:
    label: Defend openness, offer support to victims
    flavor: "We don\u2019t restrict the tool, but we\u2019ll help the victims."
    outcomeTitle: The tool remains flexible and widely used. Public trust fractures.
    outcomeText: The technology remains broadly available and continues to be used
      in many creative and commercial contexts. Victims receive assistance and resources,
      but the underlying capabilities stay unchanged. For the public, the distinction
      between tool and harm becomes harder to maintain. Usage grows, even as confidence
      in how the system is governed weakens.
