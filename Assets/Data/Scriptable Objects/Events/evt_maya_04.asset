  title: The Default Problem
  bodyText: "Most people never change the defaults. They assume defaults mean \u2018recommended\u2019.
    Are they?"
  choiceA:
    label: Make defaults explicit
    flavor: We clarify choices.
    outcomeTitle: Users think twice. They also hesitate more.
    outcomeText: Defaults are clearly labeled as choices rather than recommendations.
      Users pause to consider alternatives, and some adjust settings to better match
      their needs. Interactions become more intentional, but also slower and less
      predictable. Autonomy increases, while friction enters previously automatic
      flows.
    effects:
      industry: -1
      civilSociety: 2
      governance: 0
      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Leave defaults untouched
    flavor: Frictionless flow.
    outcomeTitle: Decisions speed up. Dependence grows quietly.
    outcomeText: The system continues to guide behavior through preselected options
      that require no extra effort. Decisions happen quickly and with minimal interruption.
      Over time, users adapt to the defaults rather than questioning them. Convenience
      remains high, as dependence grows without being explicitly acknowledged.
    effects:
      industry: 2
      civilSociety: -1
      governance: 0
      innovation: 0
