  title: The Carbon Bill
  bodyText: "Our systems don\u2019t just consume electricity. They consume it at
    scale: data centers, cooling, redundancy. In some regions, that now includes
    carbon pricing. Every megawatt-hour has a cost and an emissions tag. We can keep
    operating the same way. Or we can reduce the most energy-intensive workloads.
    Either way, the bill doesn\u2019t go away."
  choiceA:
    label: Absorb the CO2 cost
    flavor: We treat it as operating expense.
    outcomeTitle: Development continues uninterrupted. Margins quietly shrink.
    outcomeText: High-energy workloads continue to run, allowing research and product
      teams to operate without new limits. The company treats carbon pricing as just
      another line item in the budget. Over time, rising emissions costs eat into
      margins and pricing flexibility. Progress holds, while financial pressure quietly
      builds.

  choiceB:
    label: Reduce energy-heavy workloads
    flavor: We cut where it hurts most.
    outcomeTitle: Emissions fall. Some teams lose their favorite models.
    outcomeText: The most power-hungry training runs and deployments are scaled back
      or delayed. Emissions and carbon costs drop, easing public and regulatory pressure.
      Some advanced models and experiments are shelved, frustrating parts of your
      organization. Sustainability improves, while technical ambition is curtailed.
