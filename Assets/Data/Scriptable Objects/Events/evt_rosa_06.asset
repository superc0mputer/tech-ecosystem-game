  title: Gaming the Safety Net
  bodyText: "People are learning how your system works. Not everyone - but enough.
    They delay reporting income. They structure jobs to stay just below thresholds.
    They time applications to trigger higher priority. Some of this is survival.
    Some of it is exploitation. Your system can\u2019t tell the difference."
  choiceA:
    label: Tighten detection and close loopholes
    flavor: We reduce abuse.
    outcomeTitle: Abuse drops noticeably. Legitimate users feel increased pressure
      and scrutiny.
    outcomeText: Detection rules become stricter, and fewer cases slip through unnoticed.
      Some strategic manipulation is reduced, and budgets become easier to defend.
      At the same time, legitimate applicants face more reviews, requests, and delays
      as the system grows less forgiving. Compliance improves, while trust becomes
      more fragile.

  choiceB:
    label: Accept some gaming to protect the vulnerable
    flavor: We tolerate misuse.
    outcomeTitle: Fewer people are wrongly penalized. System costs and inefficiencies
      grow.
    outcomeText: The system is tuned to avoid penalizing borderline or ambiguous
      cases. More people remain eligible when their situations are unstable or hard
      to document. Alongside this, some exploitation continues, increasing overall
      costs and administrative complexity. Protection widens, even as efficiency
      erodes.
