  title: Bigger Model
  bodyText: "If we double the model size, we\u2019ll beat competitors on benchmarks.
    It\u2019ll cost a lot of compute. But technically? It\u2019s beautiful."
  choiceA:
    label: Approve the scale-up
    flavor: "Let\u2019s push it."
    outcomeTitle: Performance jumps. Costs and energy use spike.
    outcomeText: The larger model delivers stronger benchmark results and new capabilities.
      Training and inference require far more compute, driving up energy use and
      infrastructure costs. The company gains technical prestige, even as efficiency
      and margins tighten.

      innovation: 2
  choiceB:
    label: Hold the current size
    flavor: Optimize what we have.
    outcomeTitle: Costs stay under control. Technical ambition stalls.
    outcomeText: Resources are focused on tuning and deploying the existing model
      rather than expanding it. Operating costs remain predictable, and releases
      stay frequent. Competitive performance improves more slowly, and some advanced
      use cases remain out of reach.
