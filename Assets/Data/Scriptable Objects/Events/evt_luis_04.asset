  title: Are We Using Citizen Data?
  bodyText: "Someone asked whether the AI learns from citizen records. Welfare history.
    Past complaints. Address data. If it learns from this, it predicts needs better.
    If it does, people think we\u2019re profiling them."
  choiceA:
    label: Use local citizen data
    flavor: It improves accuracy.
    outcomeTitle: Predictions improve. Privacy fears rise.
    outcomeText: The system incorporates welfare records, address history, and past
      interactions to predict urgency and route cases. Some residents receive faster,
      more targeted responses as patterns are recognized. At the same time, people
      become more aware that their administrative history is shaping how they are
      treated. Accuracy increases, while perceptions of surveillance grow.

      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Avoid local data
    flavor: "We don\u2019t touch personal records."
    outcomeTitle: Trust holds. The AI feels less helpful.
    outcomeText: The AI limits itself to the information in each request, treating
      cases as isolated events. Decisions become easier to justify and audit, as
      no hidden profiles are involved. Without background data, some needs are missed
      or misprioritized. Trust is easier to sustain, even as responsiveness becomes
      less precise.
    effects:
      industry: -1
      civilSociety: 0
      governance: 2
      innovation: 0
