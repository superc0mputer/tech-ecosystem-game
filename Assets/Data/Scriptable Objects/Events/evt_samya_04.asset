  title: Technical Debt
  bodyText: "This part of the code was written fast. It works - but barely. If we
    don\u2019t refactor now, every new feature gets harder."
  choiceA:
    label: Pause features and refactor
    flavor: We clean it up.
    outcomeTitle: The system becomes more robust. Roadmaps slip quietly.
    outcomeText: Engineers focus on rewriting fragile parts of the system, reducing
      hidden bugs and future integration pain. The codebase becomes easier to extend
      and reason about. At the same time, planned features are delayed and some customer
      commitments slip. Long-term stability improves, while short-term market pressure
      increases.
    effects:
      industry: -1
      civilSociety: 0
      governance: 0
      innovation: 2
  choiceB:
    label: Ship anyway
    flavor: "We\u2019ll deal with it later."
    outcomeTitle: Progress looks fast. Complexity piles up.
    outcomeText: Features continue to reach users quickly, keeping the product competitive
      and revenue flowing. Customer-facing progress remains visible, and the team
      meets short-term targets. Behind the scenes, fixes take longer and interactions
      become harder to predict. Momentum is preserved, while the cost of maintaining
      it increases.
    effects:
      industry: 2
      civilSociety: 0
      governance: 0
      innovation: -1
