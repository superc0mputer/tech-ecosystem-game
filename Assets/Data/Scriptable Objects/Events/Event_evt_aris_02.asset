  title: Global by Name
  bodyText: "You\u2019re calling this a global product. But you test it where users
    are predictable and well-resourced. When it fails elsewhere, you call it \u2018unexpected
    behavior\u2019."
  choiceA:
    label: Design for diverse real-world conditions
    flavor: We treat global use seriously.
    effects: civil_society:2|innovation:-1
    result: The system becomes more robust across contexts. Development slows and
      assumptions are challenged.
  choiceB:
    label: Focus on primary markets first
    flavor: We scale where reliability is highest.
    effects: industry:2|civil_society:-1
    result: Performance stays strong in core markets. Failures elsewhere are normalized.
