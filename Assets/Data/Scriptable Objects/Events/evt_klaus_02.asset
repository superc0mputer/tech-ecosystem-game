  title: The Certification Conditions
  bodyText: These are the requirements you need for important certifications.
  choiceA:
    label: Meet all conditions
    flavor: We commit fully.
    outcomeTitle: You gain credibility - and a slower roadmap.
    outcomeText: The system qualifies for key certifications, opening access to regulated
      markets and institutional clients. Achieving and maintaining compliance requires
      ongoing audits, documentation, and engineering work, raising operating costs
      and stretching teams. Trust and legitimacy increase, even as development cycles
      and margins tighten.

  choiceB:
    label: Negotiate scope
    flavor: Some conditions go too far.
    outcomeTitle: 'Klaus replies, calmly: "Then the certification waits."'
    outcomeText: Certification is delayed while terms are debated. The company preserves
      more freedom to iterate, but remains excluded from markets that require formal
      approval. Revenue opportunities shift toward less regulated sectors. Progress
      continues, even as official legitimacy is put on hold.
