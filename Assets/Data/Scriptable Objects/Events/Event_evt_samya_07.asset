  title: XR Authority
  bodyText: "Inside XR, the AI highlights objects, people, options - before you even
    ask. \"The system doesn\u2019t just answer. It guides attention. Gestures. Timing.
    Users follow it instinctively.\""
  choiceA:
    label: Deploy XR as a core interface
    flavor: This is the future.
    effects: innovation:2|industry:1|civil_society:-1
    result: Adoption soars. Users defer to the system more than intended.
  choiceB:
    label: Restrict XR to experimental use
    flavor: We keep it optional.
    effects: governance:2|innovation:1|industry:-1
    result: The tech matures slowly. The sense of AI authority is contained.
