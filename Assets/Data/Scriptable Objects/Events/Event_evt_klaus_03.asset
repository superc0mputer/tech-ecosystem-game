  title: The False Positive Dilemma
  bodyText: "Your model hesitates. In uncertain situations, it defaults to do nothing.
    When inputs are unclear, the system delays decisions, escalates to humans, or
    refuses action. That reduces risk. It also shifts responsibility - and sometimes
    creates new harm. In some contexts, hesitation is safety. In others, it\u2019s
    failure."

    label: Keep the model conservative
    flavor: We prefer false negatives.

  choiceB:
    label: Tune the model to act more decisively
    flavor: We accept calculated risk.
