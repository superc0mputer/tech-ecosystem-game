  title: Who Benefits If You Succeed?
  bodyText: "Let\u2019s assume you win. Market leadership. Scale. Influence. Who
    benefits from that outcome? A narrow set of clients? Or society at large? The
    second kind of company is harder to attack - politically, legally, socially and
    is very costly."
  choiceA:
    label: Align success with broad social benefit
    flavor: We design for societal use, not just profit.
    outcomeTitle: Your success gains defenders beyond your customers. Decision-making
      becomes slower and more exposed.
    outcomeText: "Your company\u2019s success becomes legible beyond its customer
      base. Public institutions, advocacy groups, and regulators develop a stake
      in its continued operation. Decisions require broader consultation, and trade-offs
      are debated more openly. Momentum slows, but your company gains resilience,
      supported by constituencies that value its role even when performance fluctuates."

  choiceB:
    label: Optimize success for paying customers only
    flavor: We serve those who pay.
    outcomeTitle: Execution stays sharp and focused. Legitimacy depends entirely
      on performance.
    outcomeText: Strategy remains tightly focused on customer needs and measurable
      outcomes. Products evolve quickly, guided by feedback from those who finance
      their development. Influence stays concentrated, and external expectations
      remain limited. Success brings leverage, but legitimacy rests almost entirely
      on continued delivery and visible results.
