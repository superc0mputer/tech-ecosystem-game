  title: Designing for Speed
  bodyText: "We optimized for the fastest possible decisions. One tap. Minimal friction.
    But fast decisions aren\u2019t always good ones."
  choiceA:
    label: Add friction to critical actions
    flavor: We slow users down where it matters.
    outcomeTitle: Fewer mistakes. Lower completion rates.
    outcomeText: Extra confirmation steps and context are added before irreversible
      or high-impact actions. Users pause more often and catch some of their own
      mistakes. Workflows take longer, and some people abandon tasks rather than
      push through the added steps. Accuracy improves, while completion rates drop.
    effects:
      industry: -1
      civilSociety: 2
      governance: 0
      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Keep the fast paths
    flavor: Speed is value.
    outcomeTitle: Throughput stays high. Errors become invisible.
    outcomeText: High-impact actions remain one tap away, keeping interactions quick
      and fluid. Most users move through tasks with little interruption. When errors
      occur, they often go unnoticed until consequences appear elsewhere. Efficiency
      holds, even as small mistakes quietly accumulate.
