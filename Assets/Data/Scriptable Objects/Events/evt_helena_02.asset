  title: The Precedent
  bodyText: "If we approve your system, others will cite it as precedent. Some will
    copy the safeguards. Others will copy the gaps. This isn\u2019t just about you."
  choiceA:
    label: Accept stricter conditions
    flavor: We set a high bar.
    outcomeTitle: The EU standard rises. Innovation slows across the sector.
    outcomeText: Approval comes with higher requirements that shape how your system
      is built and sold. Your company becomes a reference point for compliance, gaining
      credibility with regulators and risk-averse clients. Development and market
      entry slow, but legal and political exposure decreases. The standard rises,
      and you become tied to it.
    effects:

      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Push for minimal compliance
    flavor: We follow the letter of the law.
    outcomeTitle: Market flexibility remains. Regulatory fragmentation grows.
    outcomeText: The system is approved under baseline rules, allowing faster deployment
      and lower compliance costs. Your company remains competitive in flexible markets,
      but less insulated from sector-wide backlash if others abuse the gaps. Short-term
      agility increases, while long-term regulatory security weakens.
