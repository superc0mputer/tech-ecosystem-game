  title: Who Pays the Infrastructure Cost?
  bodyText: "Data centers don\u2019t just use resources. They reshape local economies.
    Property prices near our sites have risen. Water and energy costs followed. Small
    businesses are being pushed out. We can contribute to local infrastructure. Or
    treat this as outside our responsibility. The market won\u2019t correct this
    on its own."
  choiceA:
    label: Co-invest in local infrastructure
    flavor: We offset our footprint.
    effects: civil_society:2|governance:1|industry:-2
    result: Local backlash softens. Expansion becomes more expensive.
  choiceB:
    label: Externalize the costs
    flavor: We follow market rules.
    effects: industry:2|innovation:1|civil_society:-2
    result: Margins stay strong. Social tension builds around your sites.
