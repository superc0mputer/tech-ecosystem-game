  title: The Open Model Proposal
  bodyText: "Academics are asking for access, NGOs want transparency - they\u2019re
    asking for an open version of the model, not the data, just the logic of our
    model. They say openness builds trust, but I see it diluting our ownership."
  choiceA:
    label: Keep the model closed.
    flavor: Value requires enclosure.
    outcomeTitle: Control remains intact. Skepticism grows.
    outcomeText: Control and monetization remain intact, but skepticism grows. The
      AI is seen as a black box serving private interests.
    effects:
      industry: 1
      civilSociety: -1
      governance: 0
      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Release a limited open version.
    flavor: Share without complete exposure.
    outcomeTitle: Transparency improves. Exclusivity weakens.
    outcomeText: Transparency improves and external scrutiny strengthens legitimacy.
      However, competitors learn quickly, and our grip on exclusivity weakens.
    effects:
      industry: -1
      civilSociety: 2
      governance: 1
      innovation: 0
