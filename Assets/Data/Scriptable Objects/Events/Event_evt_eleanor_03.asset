  title: What Kind of Company This Becomes
  bodyText: In ten years, this company will be one of two things. Either something
    others build on or something others replace. That depends on whether you design
    for long-term use or for fast iteration and replacement cycles. Both can be profitable.
  choiceA:
    label: Design for long-term dependence
    flavor: We become infrastructure.
    outcome: Customers rely on you deeply. Changing direction later becomes costly.
    effects:
      industry: -1
      civilSociety: 0
      governance: 2
      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Design for flexibility and turnover
    flavor: We stay flexible.
    outcome: Adoption stays high. Long-term leverage remains uncertain.
    effects:
      industry: 2
      civilSociety: 0
      governance: -1
      innovation: 0
