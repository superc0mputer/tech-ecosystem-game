  title: Predictable Harm
  bodyText: "Your system could detect risky behavior. Not diagnoses. Patterns. Escalating
    usage. Obsessive loops. Signals that precede breakdowns or worse. You could intervene.
    Slow things down. Show warnings. Redirect. But to do that, you\u2019d have to
    watch users more closely than you do now."
  choiceA:
    label: Detect and intervene in risky behavior
    flavor: We accept deeper insight to reduce harm.
    outcomeTitle: Some harm is reduced. Your system crosses a new line of behavioral
      surveillance.
    outcomeText: Some users encounter pauses, warnings, or content shifts when their
      behavior begins to resemble patterns associated with distress or addiction.
      For some, this prevents escalation; for others, it feels like the system is
      watching too closely. Interactions become safer in certain moments, but also
      less private. Support increases, even as the sense of being observed grows.
      In addition, your system must be better protected against data leaks, which
      will increase your running costs.

  choiceB:
    label: Limit monitoring to basic functionality
    flavor: "We don\u2019t profile behavior this deeply."
    outcomeTitle: Privacy boundaries remain clear. Known risk patterns stay unaddressed.
    outcomeText: Users move through the system without behavioral intervention or
      hidden scoring. Engagement remains fluid and uninterrupted, preserving a feeling
      of autonomy. At the same time, those drifting into harmful usage patterns receive
      no system-level friction or guidance. Freedom remains high, while support in
      moments of vulnerability stays external.
