  title: Fast Money, Slow Consequences
  bodyText: "You can raise money quickly right now at a high valuation. With investors
    who want growth above everything else. That money won\u2019t disappear. But its
    expectations won\u2019t slow down."
  choiceA:
    label: Take the fast capital
    flavor: We grow while the window is open.
    outcomeTitle: Resources increase immediately. Future pressure to grow intensifies.
    outcomeText: Funding arrives quickly and expands hiring, infrastructure, and
      market reach. Growth expectations rise alongside available resources, creating
      clearer priorities and faster decisions. Governance frameworks evolve in parallel,
      but under the pace set by investors. Momentum increases, while long-term flexibility
      becomes harder to preserve.
    effects:

      governance: -2
      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Raise more cautiously
    flavor: We choose who we grow with.
    outcomeTitle: Growth is steadier. Some opportunities pass.
    outcomeText: Capital is raised more selectively, aligning funding with longer
      planning cycles. Expansion remains steady, and strategic choices face fewer
      external constraints. Some opportunities move out of reach, while others become
      more manageable. Growth continues, shaped less by urgency and more by internal
      pacing.
    effects:
      industry: -1
      civilSociety: 0
      governance: 2
      innovation: 0
