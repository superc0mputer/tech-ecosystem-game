  title: Who Gets Priority?
  bodyText: "When capacity is tight, we prioritize workload. Right now, it\u2019s
    whoever pays most. We could reserve capacity for public or safety-critical uses.
    Or keep it purely commercial."
  choiceA:
    label: Reserve capacity for critical uses
    flavor: We limit peak profits.
    effects: governance:1|civil_society:1|industry:-1
    result: Essential services remain stable. Revenue opportunities shrink.
  choiceB:
    label: Keep purely commercial prioritization
    flavor: We follow the market.
    effects: industry:2|civil_society:-1|governance:-1
    result: Revenue is maximized. Access becomes uneven.
