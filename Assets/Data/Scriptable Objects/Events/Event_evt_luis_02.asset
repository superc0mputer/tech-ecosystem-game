  title: Budget Committee
  bodyText: "This AI would replace overtime hours in our call center. Fewer night
    shifts. Fewer temp contracts. But I can\u2019t pay for every safeguard and audit
    you\u2019re offering. Is there a version that just answers citizen emails automatically?"

    flavor: Safety isn't optional.
    effects: governance:2
