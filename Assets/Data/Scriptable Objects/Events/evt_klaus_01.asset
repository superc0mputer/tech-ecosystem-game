  title: The Unknown Unknowns
  bodyText: "There are behaviors of your system which your safety tests don\u2019t
    predict. How do you plan to notice them?"
  choiceA:
    label: Deploy with live monitoring
    flavor: We learn in production.
    outcomeTitle: You gain insight - after exposure.
    outcomeText: The system is released with extensive logging and real-time observation.
      Unexpected behaviors are detected as they occur, but only after users are exposed
      to them. Your company learns quickly from real-world signals, even as some
      risks are discovered too late to prevent. Insight grows, while control becomes
      more reactive.

  choiceB:
    label: Delay until confidence is higher
    flavor: "We don\u2019t guess."
    outcomeTitle: Momentum slows. Uncertainty shrinks.
    outcomeText: Additional testing and review reduce the number of unknown behaviors
      that reach users. Fewer surprises emerge after launch, and decisions rest on
      more stable evidence. Development slows, and market momentum weakens. Uncertainty
      shrinks, while opportunity costs accumulate.
