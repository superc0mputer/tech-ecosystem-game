  title: One Model to Rule Them All
  bodyText: We could merge several systems into one large model. Shared representations.
    Cleaner architecture. But if it fails, everything fails.
  choiceA:
    label: Merge the models
    flavor: Go big.
    outcome: Capabilities expand. Single points of failure emerge.
    effects:
      industry: 0
      civilSociety: 0
      governance: -1
      innovation: 2
  choiceB:
    label: Keep systems separate
    flavor: Redundancy matters.
    outcome: Systems stay stable. Progress fragments.
    effects:
      industry: 0
      civilSociety: 0
