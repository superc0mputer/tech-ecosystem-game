  title: One Model to Rule Them All
  bodyText: We could merge several systems into one large model. Shared representations.
    Cleaner architecture. But if it fails, everything fails.
  choiceA:
    label: Merge the models
    flavor: Go big.
    effects: innovation:2|governance:-1
    result: Capabilities expand. Single points of failure emerge.
  choiceB:
    label: Keep systems separate
    flavor: Redundancy matters.
    effects: governance:2|innovation:-1
    result: Systems stay stable. Progress fragments.
