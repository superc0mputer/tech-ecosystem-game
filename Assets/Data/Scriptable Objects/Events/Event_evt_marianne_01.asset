  title: The Denied Appeal
  bodyText: "A citizen appealed a welfare decision. The agency used your AI to assess
    eligibility. The appeal failed because the agency couldn\u2019t explain why the
    AI flagged the case as ineligible. My court has to decide whether that\u2019s
    acceptable."
  choiceA:
    label: Provide detailed decision logs
    flavor: We make the reasoning traceable.
    effects: governance:2|industry:-1
    result: The appeal is properly reviewed. Agencies now expect explanations every
      time.
  choiceB:
    label: Defend the decision as lawful
    flavor: The AI followed approved rules.
    effects: industry:2|governance:-1
    result: The ruling stands. Future appeals become harder.
