  title: The Time Window
  bodyText: Appeals must be filed within seven days. Miss it, and the decision stands.
    Seven days is fine - if you have stability.
  choiceA:
    label: Extend appeal deadlines
    flavor: We account for reality.
    outcomeTitle: More appeals are valid. Resolution slows.
    outcomeText: More people are able to file appeals after disruptions, illness,
      or unstable living conditions. Legitimate cases surface that would otherwise
      be lost. At the same time, the longer window invites more strategic or low-effort
      appeals, increasing review burden. Access expands, while distinguishing real
      claims from noise becomes harder.

  choiceB:
    label: Keep deadlines tight
    flavor: We need closure.
    outcomeTitle: Processes stay predictable. Late appeals disappear.
    outcomeText: Cases move quickly from decision to closure, keeping workloads predictable
      and reducing opportunities for procedural abuse. Appeals that miss the deadline
      never enter review, even when circumstances were genuine. Efficiency improves,
      while the system becomes less forgiving to those who cannot respond in time.
