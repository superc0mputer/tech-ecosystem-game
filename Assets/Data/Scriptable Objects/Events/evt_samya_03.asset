  title: XR Integration
  bodyText: "We can integrate XR into the core model. No one else has done this yet.
    But it\u2019s risky. And complex."
  choiceA:
    label: Greenlight the integration
    flavor: "Let\u2019s lead."
    outcomeTitle: The system becomes cutting-edge. Stability takes a hit.
    outcomeText: XR capabilities are woven into the core model, unlocking new interaction
      and data pathways. The system moves ahead of competitors in technical scope,
      but complexity and failure points increase. Some performance and reliability
      are sacrificed for being first. The frontier advances, while stability becomes
      harder to maintain.
    effects:
      industry: -1
      civilSociety: 0
      governance: 0
      innovation: 2
  choiceB:
    label: Keep XR separate
    flavor: Not yet.
    outcomeTitle: The product stays stable. The frontier moves elsewhere.
    outcomeText: XR remains an external module, keeping the main system predictable
      and easier to maintain. Releases stay reliable, and customer support remains
      manageable. Meanwhile, competitors explore deeper integrations. Stability holds,
      even as leadership at the cutting edge slips away.
