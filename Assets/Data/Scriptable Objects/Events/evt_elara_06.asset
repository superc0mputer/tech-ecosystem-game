  title: People Stop Questioning It
  bodyText: "Something changed. Users no longer compare the AI\u2019s suggestions
    with alternatives. They don\u2019t disagree. They don\u2019t explore. They don\u2019t
    double-check. They trust the interface too much."
  choiceA:
    label: Redesign to reintroduce friction
    flavor: We make disagreement visible again.
    outcomeTitle: Users question the AI more often. Decision speed drops. Engagement
      softens.
    outcomeText: "The interface begins to surface alternatives, uncertainty, and
      dissenting signals. Users slow down, reflect, and sometimes push back against
      the AI\u2019s advice. This leads to more careful decisions, but also to hesitation,
      friction between team members, and fewer completed tasks. Engagement and revenue
      soften, while responsibility and disagreement return to the process."

  choiceB:
    label: Keep the interface as is
    flavor: That trust is a feature.
    outcomeTitle: Usage remains high. Human judgment fades into the background.
    outcomeText: The AI continues to present clean, confident recommendations that
      feel easy to follow. Decisions stay fast, and coordination improves because
      everyone acts on the same guidance. Over time, fewer users actively evaluate
      what the system suggests. The tool becomes a shared reference point - and a
      single source of truth that is rarely questioned.
