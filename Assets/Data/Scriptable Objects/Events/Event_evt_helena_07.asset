  title: The Innovation Flight
  bodyText: "Three major AI labs are moving core R&D out of Europe. They\u2019ll
    still sell here. But training decisions, safety trade-offs, and breakthroughs
    will happen under other legal systems. If I ease conditions, I\u2019m accused
    of weakening the law. If I don\u2019t, Europe becomes a rule-taker for technologies
    it no longer shapes."
  choiceA:
    label: Move frontier research outside the EU
    flavor: We optimize for speed and leave the EU.
    effects: innovation:3|industry:1|governance:-1
    result: Research accelerates under looser constraints. European rules apply only
      after development.
  choiceB:
    label: Keep frontier research in Europe
    flavor: We build under stricter standards.
    effects: governance:3|civil_society:1|innovation:-1
    result: Development remains transparent and accountable. Breakthroughs take longer
      to reach scale.
