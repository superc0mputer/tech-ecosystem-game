  title: The Breakthrough
  bodyText: "We cracked it. The model generalizes better than anything we\u2019ve
    built. It\u2019s not just bigger. It\u2019s\u2026 different. But\u2026 I can\u2019t
    fully explain why it works yet. But if we wait, someone else will ship first."
  choiceA:
    label: Ship the breakthrough immediately
    flavor: We take the lead.
    effects: innovation:2|industry:2|governance:-1
    result: You leap ahead of competitors. Understanding lags behind deployment.
  choiceB:
    label: "Freeze deployment until it\u2019s understood"
    flavor: "We don\u2019t ship black magic."
    effects: innovation:2|governance:2|industry:-1
    result: The system becomes legible and safer. Market momentum slows.
