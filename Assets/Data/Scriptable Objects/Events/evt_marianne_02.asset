  title: Access to Evidence
  bodyText: A pedestrian was seriously injured. The traffic system adjusted signal
    timing automatically. If your AI caused unsafe conditions, this court needs to
    see exactly how it made decisions - in real time.
  choiceA:
    label: Open the system completely
    flavor: We allow full forensic access.
    outcomeTitle: "The investigation is thorough. Design flaws become legally visible
      \u2014 and expensive to fix."
    outcomeText: Investigators gain full access to logs, models, and real-time decision
      traces, allowing a detailed reconstruction of the incident. The court can assess
      whether the system contributed to unsafe conditions. Any design weaknesses
      that surface now carry legal and financial consequences. Accountability increases,
      while engineering and liability costs rise.

      governance: 3
      innovation: -1
  choiceB:
    label: Fight disclosure
    flavor: We challenge the request.
    outcomeTitle: The company avoids deep scrutiny. Trust in automated infrastructure
      drops sharply.
    outcomeText: The company limits what the court can examine, keeping internal
      systems and methods out of public view. Immediate legal exposure is reduced
      and operations continue with minimal disruption. At the same time, unanswered
      questions linger about how the system behaves under stress. Control is maintained,
      even as confidence in automated decision-making weakens.

      governance: -1
