  title: Dual-Use Reality
  bodyText: "Your AI can optimize logistics, prediction, and coordination. Those
    are civilian features - and military ones. If you don\u2019t plan for defense
    use, others will use it without constraints."
  choiceA:
    label: Engage in dual-use planning
    flavor: We help define limits.
    outcomeTitle: You help define limits from inside the system. Publicly, nothing
      changes.
    outcomeText: "The company becomes involved in defining safeguards and operational
      boundaries within defense contexts. Some constraints are shaped early, embedded
      before alternative implementations take hold. Publicly, the system\u2019s role
      appears unchanged, as defense use remains indirect or undisclosed. Influence
      increases inside closed environments, while visibility stays limited."

  choiceB:
    label: Commit to civilian-only use
    flavor: We stay civilian.
    outcomeTitle: Your position is clear. So is your lack of influence over military
      applications.
    outcomeText: "The company\u2019s stance is stated clearly and consistently across
      partnerships. Civilian applications remain the focus, and public alignment
      strengthens. Military use proceeds independently, adapted from external sources
      without your input. The boundary holds, even as control over how similar systems
      are applied elsewhere recedes."
