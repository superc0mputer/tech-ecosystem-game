  title: When Silence Is a Signal
  bodyText: "These users stop using the system. They don\u2019t complain. They just
    disappear. Not because they\u2019re satisfied. Because they don\u2019t think
    it will help. If no one objects, do you assume success?"
  choiceA:
    label: Investigate silent drop-offs
    flavor: We treat disengagement as a warning.
    outcomeTitle: Hidden harms surface. Metrics become harder to interpret.
    outcomeText: Analysis reveals that many silent drop-offs come from users facing
      language barriers, misclassification, or repeated low-grade failures. These
      issues rarely generate tickets, but they shape who the system effectively serves.
      Fixing them improves accessibility and fairness, even as aggregate performance
      metrics become noisier and less cleanly upward-sloping.

  choiceB:
    label: Focus on active feedback only
    flavor: We respond to visible signals.
    outcomeTitle: Dashboards stay clean. Some failures never register.
    outcomeText: Development is guided by consistent, actionable feedback from users
      who actively engage with the system. Improvements compound quickly, reinforcing
      reliability for established use cases. Users who disengage without signaling
      remain outside the feedback loop, narrowing the scope of optimization. The
      system becomes more predictable and efficient, even as its understanding of
      marginal or atypical experiences remains limited.
