  title: The Secrecy Clause
  bodyText: This clause in the contract means you cannot disclose how the AI is used,
    even to regulators or the public, without permission. Secrecy prevents adversaries
    from learning our capabilities.
  choiceA:
    label: Sign the clause
    flavor: Oversight becomes internal.
    outcomeTitle: Oversight becomes internal. Trust becomes institutional, not public.
    outcomeText: "Information about deployment and use becomes tightly contained.
      Oversight shifts inward, relying on internal reviews and trusted counterparts
      rather than external scrutiny. The partnership proceeds efficiently, but public
      understanding of the system\u2019s role remains limited. Trust is maintained
      through institutions and contracts, not through visibility."

  choiceB:
    label: Refuse
    flavor: Transparency is non-negotiable.
    outcomeTitle: "Voss closes the folder. \"Then we can\u2019t work together.\""
    outcomeText: Negotiations end without escalation or public comment. The system
      stays subject to regulatory and public disclosure standards, but the opportunity
      for classified collaboration closes. Development continues in open contexts,
      while secrecy becomes a condition imposed by others, elsewhere.
