  title: The Supplier Question
  bodyText: Some of our critical components come from high-risk supply chains. Rare
    earths. Specialty chips. Cooling materials. Subcontractors flagged for unsafe
    labor conditions and forced overtime. We can switch to audited suppliers. But
    it will cost more.
  choiceA:
    label: Source from audited ethical suppliers
    flavor: We pay the premium.
    outcomeTitle: Supply chains become cleaner. Expansion slows and costs rise.
    outcomeText: The company shifts to suppliers that meet verified labor and safety
      standards. Procurement becomes more transparent, and the risk of scandals tied
      to forced labor or unsafe conditions drops. But higher prices and longer lead
      times slow hardware expansion and raise operating costs. Ethical credibility
      improves, while scale becomes harder to achieve.
    effects:
      industry: -1
      civilSociety: 0
      governance: 2
      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Stick with current suppliers
    flavor: We follow the market.
    outcomeTitle: Hardware stays cheap. Ethical risk remains embedded.
    outcomeText: The existing supply network keeps components cheap and readily available,
      supporting rapid build-out of data center capacity. Production stays flexible
      and competitive. At the same time, labor and safety issues remain part of the
      chain, exposing the company to reputational and regulatory risk. Speed is preserved,
      while ethical uncertainty continues in the background.

      industry: 2

      governance: -1
      innovation: 0
