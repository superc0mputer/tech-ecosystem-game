  title: Dual-Use Reality
  bodyText: "Your AI can optimize logistics, prediction, and coordination. Those
    are civilian features - and military ones. If you don\u2019t plan for defense
    use, others will use it without constraints."
  choiceA:
    label: Engage in dual-use planning
    flavor: We help define limits.
    outcome: You help define limits from inside the system. Publicly, nothing changes.
    effects:
      industry: 2
      civilSociety: -1
      governance: 0
      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Commit to civilian-only use
    flavor: We stay civilian.
    outcome: Your position is clear. So is your lack of influence over military applications.
