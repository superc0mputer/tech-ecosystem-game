  title: Cooling vs. Capability
  bodyText: The new model runs hotter. To keep performance, we need more cooling
    - more power, more water. Or we cap performance.
  choiceA:
    label: Upgrade cooling systems
    flavor: We maintain capability.
    outcomeTitle: Performance holds. Operating costs and resource use rise.
    outcomeText: "Additional cooling infrastructure is installed to support the new
      model\u2019s heat output. Performance and reliability remain high as workloads
      increase. Energy and water consumption rise sharply, pushing up operating costs
      and drawing attention to the facility\u2019s environmental footprint. Capability
      is preserved, while sustainability becomes harder to manage."

  choiceB:
    label: Cap model intensity
    flavor: We respect physical limits.
    outcomeTitle: Resource use stabilizes. Model growth plateaus.
    outcomeText: Limits are placed on how hard the model can run, keeping power and
      cooling demands within existing capacity. Resource use becomes more predictable
      and easier to justify to regulators and local communities. The system continues
      to operate, but its ability to scale or adopt more demanding models is constrained.
      Stability improves, while technical ambition is held back.
