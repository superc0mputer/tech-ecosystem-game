  title: The Growth Shortcut
  bodyText: "We\u2019re stalling. Not because the product is bad - but because we\u2019re
    picky. There are markets asking for access now. Different languages. Different
    norms. Different risks. We can launch a lightweight version. Fewer checks. Less
    localization. Faster growth. It just\u2026 won\u2019t fit everywhere equally
    well."
  choiceA:
    label: Launch fast and wide
    flavor: Growth first. We'll fix later.
    outcome: User numbers spike across regions. Local friction quietly accumulates.
    effects:
      industry: 3
      civilSociety: -1
      governance: -1
      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Localize and adapt before launch
    flavor: We scale with care.
    outcome: Expansion is slower but steadier. Marcus checks his watch.
    effects:
      industry: -2
