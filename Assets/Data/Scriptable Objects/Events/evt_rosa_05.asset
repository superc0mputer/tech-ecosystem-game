  title: The Decision Was the System
  bodyText: Agencies are changing how they talk to people. When someone asks why
    they were rejected, the answer is always the same. The system decided. Not the
    agency. Not a caseworker. Your product.
  choiceA:
    label: Force clients to retain visible responsibility
    flavor: No decision without a human name attached.
    outcomeTitle: Accountability returns to institutions. Some clients resist or
      delay adoption.
    outcomeText: Agencies are required to attach a named official to each decision,
      even when the system provides the recommendation. Appeals and complaints find
      a clear point of contact, and reasoning becomes easier to challenge. Some clients
      slow or pause adoption, as liability becomes more explicit. Accountability
      strengthens, while friction increases.

  choiceB:
    label: Allow full delegation to the system
    flavor: Clients choose how they use it.
    outcomeTitle: Your system becomes the final authority. Responsibility dissolves
      upward.
    outcomeText: Decisions are issued directly by the system, embedded in automated
      workflows. Caseworkers and agencies act as operators rather than authors of
      outcomes. Processing accelerates, and consistency improves. Over time, responsibility
      becomes harder to locate, as authority shifts from institutions to infrastructure.
