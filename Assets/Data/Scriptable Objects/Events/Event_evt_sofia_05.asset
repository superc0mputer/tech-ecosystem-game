  title: The Face Everyone Recognizes
  bodyText: "This one\u2019s bad. A deepfake. Sexual. Degrading. A real person. Not
    famous. Some persons lost their jobs. But the videos aren\u2019t illegal everywhere.
    This isn\u2019t about tools anymore. It\u2019s about responsibility."
  choiceA:
    label: Take responsibility publicly
    flavor: We act, even if it costs us.
    effects: governance:2|civil_society:2|industry:-1
    result: Abuse drops sharply. Your platform is no longer framed as neutral infrastructure.
  choiceB:
    label: Defend openness, offer support to victims
    flavor: "We don\u2019t restrict the tool, but we\u2019ll help the victims."
    effects: industry:2|innovation:1|civil_society:-2
    result: The tool remains flexible and widely used. Public trust fractures.
