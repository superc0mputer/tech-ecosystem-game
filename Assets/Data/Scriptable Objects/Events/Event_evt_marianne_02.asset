  title: Access to Evidence
  bodyText: A pedestrian was seriously injured. The traffic system adjusted signal
    timing automatically. If your AI caused unsafe conditions, this court needs to
    see exactly how it made decisions - in real time.
  choiceA:
    label: Open the system completely
    flavor: We allow full forensic access.
    outcome: "The investigation is thorough. Design flaws become legally visible
      \u2014 and expensive to fix."
    effects:
      industry: -1
      civilSociety: 0
      governance: 3
      innovation: -1
  choiceB:
    label: Fight disclosure
    flavor: We challenge the request.
    outcome: The company avoids deep scrutiny. Trust in automated infrastructure
      drops sharply.
