  title: AI Art Wins a Prize
  bodyText: "An AI-generated piece just won a major design award. The judges didn\u2019t
    know, but no rules were broken. Artists are furious. The jury is embarrassed.
    And everyone\u2019s asking the same question: Is this a story about innovation
    or about creative work being quietly displaced?"
  choiceA:
    label: Frame it as a breakthrough
    flavor: We highlight what the technology enables.
    outcomeTitle: The headline celebrates progress. Human creators feel written out
      of the story.
    outcomeText: Public attention centers on the capabilities of the system and what
      it can produce. The moment is cited as evidence that creative work can be automated
      at a high level. For many human artists, the story feels less like celebration
      and more like erasure, as their labor becomes harder to distinguish from generated
      output. Innovation gains momentum, while the meaning of authorship becomes
      less clear.

  choiceB:
    label: Push for transparency in creative contests
    flavor: We call for clearer boundaries.
    outcomeTitle: "The debate becomes more nuanced. The hype cools \u2014 so does
      momentum."
    outcomeText: Organizers and platforms begin to clarify what counts as human and
      what counts as generated work. The conversation shifts from spectacle to definitions
      and disclosure. Some excitement fades as rules take shape, but creators gain
      a clearer sense of where they stand. The debate deepens, even as the rush to
      celebrate novelty slows.
