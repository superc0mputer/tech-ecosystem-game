  title: The Moving Target
  bodyText: I can certify what exists today. Not what your system becomes tomorrow.
    If I allow continuous learning, oversight weakens. If I freeze models, I approve
    systems I know will age badly.
  choiceA:
    label: Accept ongoing regulatory oversight
    flavor: We regulate the process.
    outcomeTitle: Systems evolve under supervision. Innovation continues - but ships
      slower.
    outcomeText: Models continue to evolve, but updates are reported, logged, and
      reviewed by regulators. When problems emerge, authorities can trace when and
      how changes were introduced, making intervention and accountability possible.
      Your company keeps improving the system, though at a slower pace. Oversight
      becomes active, while rapid iteration becomes harder to sustain.

  choiceB:
    label: Freeze approved versions
    flavor: We regulate stability.
    outcomeTitle: Certification stays simple. The system falls behind its own research.
    outcomeText: Approved models remain unchanged, giving regulators a stable target
      to certify and monitor. New capabilities are developed internally but are not
      reflected in deployed systems. Compliance stays simple, but oversight becomes
      increasingly detached from what the technology could actually do. Control holds,
      while relevance fades.
