  title: Which Language the System Speaks
  bodyText: "Your system works best in English and a few other widely used languages.
    That\u2019s not a surprise. Most of the data is there. Most of the testing too.
    But when people explain complex situations in a second language, they simplify,
    shorten and avoid nuance. The system still responds. Just not as well. I know
    why you haven\u2019t expanded language support. Training is expensive. Evaluation
    is harder. Mistakes are easier to miss. But right now, fluency decides who the
    system understands best."
  choiceA:
    label: Expand training to underrepresented languages
    flavor: The system should understand more people.
    outcomeTitle: Access broadens. Testing becomes harder.
    outcomeText: The model begins to support more languages and mixed-language inputs.
      Performance improves for users who previously had to simplify or translate
      their problems. At the same time, quality still varies between languages, and
      new errors are harder to detect. So, development slows as testing and validation
      become more complex.

  choiceB:
    label: Focus on high-quality support for major languages
    flavor: Understanding fewer languages well is more efficient.
    outcomeTitle: Accuracy stays high. The user base narrows.
    outcomeText: Accuracy remains high in the supported languages. Updates stay predictable,
      and responsibility is easy to trace when something goes wrong. In regions where
      these languages are not widely spoken, complex cases are used less often with
      the system. The AI handles routine decisions, while nuanced situations are
      delayed or handled outside the system. The technology remains reliable where
      it performs best. Elsewhere, its role quietly narrows.
