  title: The Near Miss
  bodyText: A stress test failed. No one was hurt. Under rare conditions, your system
    triggered a cascading error. Human operators intervened in time. If this happens
    in the wild, someone without a safety team will be on the receiving end.
  choiceA:
    label: Redesign before certification
    flavor: We eliminate even low-probability harm.

    result: Systemic risk drops sharply. Release timelines stretch.
  choiceB:
    label: Proceed with certification as is
    flavor: We rely on operational safeguards.
    effects: industry:3|innovation:1|civil_society:-1
    result: Klaus raises an eyebrow but proceeds with the paperwork.
