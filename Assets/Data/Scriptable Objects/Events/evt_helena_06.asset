  title: The Compliance Ceiling
  bodyText: "Only a handful of companies can meet full AI Act compliance. Mostly
    large players. Smaller firms are falling behind. Some are leaving Europe. If
    we simplify compliance, risks rise. If we don\u2019t, innovation concentrates."
  choiceA:
    label: Simplify compliance requirements
    flavor: We lower the barrier.
    outcomeTitle: More players stay in the market. Oversight becomes thinner.
    outcomeText: Your company becomes a visible voice for lighter, more flexible
      regulation. Smaller firms and startups cite your position as they push to stay
      in the market. Some regulators listen; others push back. Competition increases,
      while formal oversight grows thinner and more contested.
    effects:
      industry: 1
      civilSociety: 0
      governance: -2
      innovation: 2
  choiceB:
    label: Maintain strict compliance
    flavor: We protect the standard.
    outcomeTitle: Safety remains high. The market consolidates around a few giants.
    outcomeText: Your company aligns itself with the existing regulatory framework
      and the institutions enforcing it. Policymakers treat you as a reliable partner,
      even as smaller players fall away. The market consolidates around firms that
      can afford compliance. Stability increases, while diversity of approaches declines.
    effects:
      industry: 0
      civilSociety: 1
      governance: 2
      innovation: -2
