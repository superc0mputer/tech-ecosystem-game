  title: Synthetic Users
  bodyText: "Most of our testing users aren\u2019t real. They\u2019re AI agents simulating
    demand. It lets us scale fast. Real users come later. Your usage metrics look
    amazing, by the way."
  choiceA:
    label: Allow synthetic load
    flavor: Growth signals are signals.
    outcomeTitle: Adoption metrics explode. Reality lags behind dashboards.
    outcomeText: Usage metrics climb rapidly as simulated demand fills dashboards
      and investor reports. Planning and prioritization begin to rely on patterns
      generated by agents rather than people. The system appears validated before
      it is meaningfully used, creating confidence that outpaces lived experience.
      Growth becomes easier to demonstrate than to verify.

      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Require real-user validation
    flavor: We measure actual impact.
    outcomeTitle: Metrics slow down. Credibility improves.
    outcomeText: Adoption grows more slowly, shaped by real behavior and real constraints.
      Metrics reflect fewer users, but clearer signals about how the system is actually
      used. Decisions are grounded in observed impact rather than projected scale.
      Credibility strengthens, even as momentum becomes harder to sustain.
