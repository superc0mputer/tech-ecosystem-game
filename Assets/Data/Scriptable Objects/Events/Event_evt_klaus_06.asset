  title: The First Casualty
  bodyText: Your system was certified. Deployed according to guidelines. A downstream
    operator followed the manual. A decision was delayed. Someone died. This is the
    first real-world death linked to a certified system.
  choiceA:
    label: Suspend deployment and reopen certification
    flavor: We treat this as a systemic failure.
    effects: governance:1|civil_society:2|industry:-2
    result: Trust in certification is rebuilt slowly. Your product becomes a warning
      case for the entire sector.
  choiceB:
    label: Treat it as operational misuse
    flavor: We stand by the certification.
    effects: industry:2|innovation:1|civil_society:-2
    result: Deployment continues. Certification becomes a shield - not a guarantee.
