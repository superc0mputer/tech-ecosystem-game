  title: The Missing Document
  bodyText: "Your system is reviewing applications for emergency housing assistance.
    It flags them often as incomplete. One missing document. A payslip. A lease.
    A proof of address. People who are stable can upload it tomorrow. People who
    are already losing their home often can\u2019t."
  choiceA:
    label: Allow provisional approval
    flavor: We give time to fix errors.
    outcomeTitle: More households remain eligible while documents are completed.
      Case handling becomes slower and more complex.
    outcomeText: Applicants are kept in the system while missing paperwork is resolved,
      allowing some families to avoid immediate displacement. Caseworkers manage
      more open files and follow-ups, increasing administrative load. Support becomes
      more responsive to unstable situations, even as resolution times lengthen.

  choiceB:
    label: Enforce strict completeness
    flavor: "We decide based on what\u2019s submitted."
    outcomeTitle: Processing stays fast and predictable. Applicants with unstable
      situations drop out first.
    outcomeText: Decisions are made quickly based on the documents available at the
      moment of review. Processing remains efficient and consistent. Applicants who
      cannot supply paperwork in time are filtered out early. Throughput improves,
      while access narrows for those in the most precarious circumstances.
