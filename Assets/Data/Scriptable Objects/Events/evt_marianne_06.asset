  title: The Automated Rejection
  bodyText: "An asylum application was rejected. Your AI was used to pre-filter cases.
    The system marked the case as low risk. That meant no full hearing. The applicant
    was deported. Three weeks later, he was killed. This court is examining your
    company\u2019s role."
  choiceA:
    label: Withdraw the pre-filtering feature from asylum use
    flavor: We change where our product may be used.
    outcomeTitle: Courts regain confidence in human review. Your product loses a
      major public-sector use case.
    outcomeText: The feature is removed from asylum and similar high-stakes processes,
      restoring mandatory human review in these cases. Courts and agencies treat
      the move as a recognition of systemic risk. Your company loses access to a
      significant public-sector market, but legal and ethical exposure in life-or-death
      decisions is reduced.

  choiceB:
    label: Keep the feature, strengthen contractual safeguards
    flavor: We limit our liability, not the product.
    outcomeTitle: "Deployments continue. Your company stays legally insulated \u2014
      morally questioned."
    outcomeText: Pre-filtering remains in use, with contracts shifting responsibility
      to the agencies that rely on it. Deployments continue without technical changes,
      and revenue is preserved. At the same time, scrutiny grows over how life-altering
      decisions are delegated to automation. Legal protection increases, while public
      trust weakens.
