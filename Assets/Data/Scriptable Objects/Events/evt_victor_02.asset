  title: The Exclusive Licensing Deal
  bodyText: "A major insurance consortium is interested - very interested. They don\u2019t
    just want access to our product, they want exclusivity. If we say yes, we define
    the market. If we say no, someone else will."
  choiceA:
    label: Grant exclusivity.
    flavor: Create scarcity.
    outcomeTitle: Revenue stabilizes. Access becomes uneven.
    outcomeText: Revenue stabilizes and technical development accelerates under guaranteed
      demand. However, access to advanced AI support becomes uneven, reinforcing
      a privatized model landscape. Critics argue that product quality is now determined
      by purchasing power rather than need.
    effects:
      industry: 2
      civilSociety: -1
      governance: 0
      innovation: 1
  choiceB:
    label: Reject exclusivity.
    flavor: Keep access open.
    outcomeTitle: Access remains open. Innovation plateaus.
    outcomeText: The system remains broadly accessible, but funding becomes fragmented
      and slower to materialize. Innovation plateaus, and competitors begin to narrow
      the gap. Victor considers the refusal a strategic failure to consolidate influence.

      governance: 0
