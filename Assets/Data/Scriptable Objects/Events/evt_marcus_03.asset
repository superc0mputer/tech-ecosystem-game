  title: Engagement by Design
  bodyText: "These are engagement loops. Nudges. Defaults. Nothing illegal. Nothing
    obvious. People like being guided. We\u2019d just help them choose faster."
  choiceA:
    label: Implement the nudges.
    flavor: Engagement first.
    outcomeTitle: "Usage rises. Users stay longer \u2014 often without knowing why."
    outcomeText: Subtle design choices begin to shape user behavior. Decisions feel
      faster and easier, and overall usage time increases. Most users experience
      the system as more intuitive, without noticing how strongly defaults and prompts
      guide their actions. Engagement metrics improve, while the line between assistance
      and influence becomes harder to define. The system works better by caring less
      about whether users understand how it works.

  choiceB:
    label: Explain the system.
    flavor: They deserve to know.
    outcomeTitle: "Marcus raises an eyebrow. \"You really don\u2019t like asymmetry,
      do you?\""
    outcomeText: Explanations slow interactions and introduce friction into previously
      seamless flows. Some users appreciate the transparency, while others disengage
      when confronted with complexity. Engagement drops slightly, but expectations
      become clearer on both sides. The system becomes easier to trust and harder
      to optimize, as influence is replaced with consent that must be actively maintained.
