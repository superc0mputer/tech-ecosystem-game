  title: The Cheap Pilot
  bodyText: "You\u2019re offering free AI tools to local governments, which also
    bring great benefits. No cost. No long-term contract. But once systems adapt
    around your product, leaving becomes expensive."
  choiceA:
    label: Add exit guarantees and local ownership
    flavor: We make withdrawal possible.
    outcomeTitle: Finalizing contracts takes time, risking cancellation.
    outcomeText: Finalizing the contracts takes time. Questions about data ownership
      and exit conditions can no longer be postponed, and some cities decide the
      effort outweighs the benefit. Those that stay integrate your system cautiously,
      keeping alternatives in place. Your AI becomes a helpful presence rather than
      a silent default - chosen deliberately, and always replaceable.
    effects:
      industry: -1
      civilSociety: 2
      governance: 0
      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Launch as planned
    flavor: We lower barriers first.
    outcomeTitle: Workflows adapt fast, creating quiet dependence.
    outcomeText: The rollout is smooth and fast and covers a lot of regions. Workflows
      adapt and your system settles quietly into daily routines. By the time contracts
      are discussed, removing it would mean disruption few are willing to face. Dependence
      forms without ceremony, and your AI becomes infrastructure before anyone notices.
