  title: People Stop Questioning It
  bodyText: "Something changed. Users no longer compare the AI\u2019s suggestions
    with alternatives. They don\u2019t disagree. They don\u2019t explore. They don\u2019t
    double-check. They trust the interface too much."
  choiceA:
    label: Redesign to reintroduce friction
    flavor: We make disagreement visible again.
    effects: civil_society:2|governance:2|industry:-1
    result: Users question the AI more often. Decision speed drops. Engagement softens.
  choiceB:
    label: Keep the interface as is
    flavor: That trust is a feature.
    effects: industry:3|innovation:2
    result: Usage remains high. Human judgment fades into the background.
