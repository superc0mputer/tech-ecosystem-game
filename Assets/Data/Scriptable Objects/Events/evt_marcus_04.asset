  title: The Feature Creep Question
  bodyText: "There\u2019s talk of cutting a feature because users might misuse it.
    Why would we do that? If potential misuse is the bar for removal, innovation
    doesn\u2019t get off the ground."
  choiceA:
    label: Keep the feature.
    flavor: "Choice is the user\u2019s."
    outcomeTitle: Flexibility increases. Responsibility becomes abstract.
    outcomeText: The system gains flexibility, and advanced users find new ways to
      adapt it to their needs. At the same time, edge cases multiply, and unintended
      uses become harder to predict. When harm occurs, responsibility is difficult
      to locate, spread across design, deployment, and user choice. Innovation continues,
      but governance shifts from prevention to explanation after the fact.
    effects:
      industry: 0
      civilSociety: -1
      governance: -1
      innovation: 1
  choiceB:
    label: Remove it.
    flavor: We design with intent.
    outcomeTitle: "Marcus shrugs. \"Constraints are very\u2026 European.\""
    outcomeText: The system becomes more constrained, and certain use cases disappear
      entirely. Potential misuse is reduced, but so is the range of experimentation
      available to users and developers. Decisions feel more deliberate, but also
      more paternalistic. Innovation slows, even as accountability becomes clearer
      and easier to defend.
    effects:
      industry: 0
      civilSociety: 2
      governance: 0
      innovation: -1
