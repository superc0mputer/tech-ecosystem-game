  title: The Exit Window
  bodyText: "We have an offer. Big one. A larger company wants to acquire us. They
    want our product and our speed. They\u2019ll keep building on your AI which we
    use for our product. That only works if your AI keeps powering it. If you support
    the transition, the deal closes fast and your technology becomes part of someone
    else\u2019s strategy. If you don\u2019t, they\u2019ll either walk \u2014 or rebuild
    without you."
  choiceA:
    label: Support the acquisition
    flavor: We stay inside the deal.
    outcomeTitle: The product scales rapidly under new ownership. Your AI becomes
      harder to disentangle from external decisions.
    outcomeText: "The acquisition closes quickly, and the product scales through
      existing networks and distribution channels. Your AI becomes embedded in a
      larger organization\u2019s strategy, priorities, and timelines. Influence continues,
      but indirectly, shaped by decisions made beyond your control. The technology
      spreads faster, even as disentangling it from external objectives becomes increasingly
      difficult."

  choiceB:
    label: Withhold deep cooperation
    flavor: "We don\u2019t follow every exit."
    outcomeTitle: The acquisition slows or reshapes. Your AI is replaced or reworked
      beyond your influence.
    outcomeText: "The deal is restructured as dependencies become explicit. The acquiring
      company reassesses integration costs and long-term reliance on your system.
      In some paths, your AI is replaced or adapted to fit different constraints.
      Control over use remains clearer, while influence over the product\u2019s future
      diminishes."
