  title: The EU Audit
  bodyText: "The EU wants to audit our AI use. They\u2019re asking how decisions
    are made - and who oversees them. If they find violations, this won\u2019t stay
    a city problem."
  choiceA:
    label: Open the system to auditors
    flavor: We cooperate fully.
    effects: governance:3|civil_society:1|industry:-1

  choiceB:
    label: Limit disclosure
    flavor: We provide summaries only.
    effects: industry:3|governance:-1|civil_society:-1
    result: The city avoids immediate sanctions. Scrutiny intensifies.
