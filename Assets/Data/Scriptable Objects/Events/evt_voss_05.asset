  title: The First Deployment
  bodyText: "Your system is ready. We want to deploy it in an active military operation.
    It won\u2019t pull a trigger. But its recommendations will shape real decisions."
  choiceA:
    label: Approve deployment
    flavor: Real world impact.
    outcomeTitle: Your AI is used in real-world operations. You are no longer theorizing
      about impact.
    outcomeText: "The system\u2019s recommendations enter live operational decision-making.
      Target selection becomes more data-driven, reducing certain forms of error
      and collateral damage. Human operators retain final authority, but increasingly
      rely on algorithmic assessments to justify speed and precision. Responsibility
      for lethal outcomes is shared across code, command, and procedure. The system
      does not pull a trigger, yet it reshapes how killing is optimized and explained."

  choiceB:
    label: Refuse
    flavor: We draw the line.
    outcomeTitle: You draw a line. The operation proceeds without your system.
    outcomeText: The system is kept outside active operations, and lethal decisions
      remain unmediated by algorithmic recommendation. Responsibility stays concentrated
      with human commanders, without the procedural buffering of automated assessments.
      Your company avoids becoming part of a chain that translates data into force.
      The boundary does not prevent others from pursuing efficiency, but it defines
      where this system, and your organization, stand.
