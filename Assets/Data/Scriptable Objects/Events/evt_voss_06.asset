  title: The Allied Request
  bodyText: "An allied nation is requesting access to the system. They\u2019re stable.
    Friendly. Strategically important. Once access is granted, control doesn\u2019t
    stay technical. It becomes diplomatic."
  choiceA:
    label: Approve transfer
    flavor: Allies need support.
    outcomeTitle: Your AI spreads through military alliances. Retracting it later
      becomes impossible.
    outcomeText: The system is adopted by allied forces and used across different
      command structures. While the technology remains the same, rules of engagement
      and legal standards vary by country. Over time, the system supports decisions
      made under assumptions you did not design for. Control fades not through misuse,
      but through divergence in how "acceptable" outcomes are defined.

  choiceB:
    label: Deny transfer
    flavor: Limit proliferation.
    outcomeTitle: You limit proliferation. You strain political relationships.
    outcomeText: Access to the system remains limited to a single command structure
      with shared rules and legal standards. Decisions supported by the AI stay within
      a framework you can influence and review. Allies pursue alternative tools or
      adapt existing ones, reducing dependency on your system. Control remains clearer,
      while coordination across partners becomes less integrated.

      innovation: 0
