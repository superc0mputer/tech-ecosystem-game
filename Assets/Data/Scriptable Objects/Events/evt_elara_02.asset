  title: Not Designed for Everyone
  bodyText: "Users with visual impairments struggle. Key actions rely on color, small
    targets, and so on. Fixing this means redesigning core interaction patterns.
    That\u2019s weeks of work. And none of our largest clients are asking for it."
  choiceA:
    label: Fix accessibility now
    flavor: We redesign the interface.
    outcomeTitle: The product becomes usable for more people. Delivery slows across
      the roadmap.
    outcomeText: The interface is redesigned to support screen readers, keyboard
      control, voice input, and high-contrast layouts. People who could not reliably
      use the system before gain full access. Implementing and maintaining these
      alternative interaction paths adds complexity and ongoing costs to the product.
      Inclusion expands, while development and support become more expensive.

  choiceB:
    label: Defer accessibility
    flavor: We focus on current customers.
    outcomeTitle: Enterprise deadlines are met. Some users remain locked out.
    outcomeText: The team keeps building what current enterprise customers are paying
      for, hitting deadlines and avoiding disruptive redesigns. The product remains
      polished for its main user base, and revenue stays predictable. Users who need
      accessible design continue to struggle or leave. Momentum is preserved, even
      as the audience narrows.
