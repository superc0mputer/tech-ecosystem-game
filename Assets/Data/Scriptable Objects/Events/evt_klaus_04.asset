  title: The Near Miss
  bodyText: A stress test failed. No one was hurt. Under rare conditions, your system
    triggered a cascading error. Human operators intervened in time. If this happens
    in the wild, someone without a safety team will be on the receiving end.
  choiceA:
    label: Redesign before certification
    flavor: We eliminate even low-probability harm.
    outcomeTitle: Systemic risk drops sharply. Release timelines stretch.
    outcomeText: Engineers revisit core components to remove the failure mode that
      caused the cascade. The likelihood of rare but severe breakdowns drops significantly.
      Certification and deployment are delayed as new tests are added. Safety margins
      widen, while time to market slips.

  choiceB:
    label: Proceed with certification as is
    flavor: We rely on operational safeguards.
    outcomeTitle: Klaus raises an eyebrow but proceeds with the paperwork.
    outcomeText: The system is approved based on existing safeguards and operational
      procedures. Release moves forward quickly, and performance remains strong under
      normal conditions. The rare failure remains theoretically contained, but is
      now part of real-world risk. Momentum grows, while a small chance of large
      impact stays unresolved.
