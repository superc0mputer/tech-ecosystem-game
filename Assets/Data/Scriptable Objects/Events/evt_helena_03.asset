  title: Strategic Dependence
  bodyText: "When something breaks, they call Brussels. Even if the infrastructure
    isn\u2019t European. Your AI depends on non-EU chips and cloud layers. That\u2019s
    efficient. It\u2019s also a political liability. If I push for localization,
    I\u2019m accused of protectionism. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019m blamed for dependency."
  choiceA:
    label: Commit to EU-based infrastructure
    flavor: We reduce strategic risk.
    outcomeTitle: Resilience improves. Costs rise, innovation slows in Europe.
    outcomeText: Your company shifts key systems onto European chips and cloud providers,
      reducing exposure to external political shocks. Reliability and regulatory
      trust improve, but operating costs rise and some technical advantages are lost.
      European deployments become easier to defend, even as global competitiveness
      tightens. Stability increases, while flexibility declines.

  choiceB:
    label: Keep global infrastructure
    flavor: We stay competitive.
    outcomeTitle: Growth remains strong. Control sits outside democratic reach.
    outcomeText: The system continues to rely on global chips and cloud providers,
      keeping costs low and access to advanced technology high. In stable periods,
      performance and scale remain strong. When disruptions or political tensions
      arise, key components sit outside EU jurisdiction, limiting oversight and intervention.
      Competitiveness holds, while public authorities have less leverage over critical
      infrastructure.
