  title: Who Gets a Voice?
  bodyText: "Your feedback channels are clean. But they\u2019re not neutral. Complaints
    require time, literacy, stability. The people most affected rarely submit them.
    If you wait for feedback, you\u2019ll only hear from the comfortable."
  choiceA:
    label: Actively seek feedback from marginalized users
    flavor: We go where silence is.
    outcomeTitle: Blind spots shrink. Research costs increase.
    outcomeText: New feedback channels surface issues that rarely appear in standard
      reports. Assumptions are challenged, and previously invisible failure modes
      become harder to ignore. So, insights deepen, but gathering them requires time,
      trust-building, and sustained effort. Overall, understanding improves, while
      iteration slows and research costs rise.

  choiceB:
    label: Rely on existing feedback mechanisms
    flavor: We listen to who speaks up.
    outcomeTitle: Signals remain easy to process. Some harms never surface.
    outcomeText: "Feedback remains consistent, structured, and easy to act on. Reported
      issues align closely with the experiences of stable and well-resourced users.
      Development proceeds efficiently, guided by clear signals. Problems affecting
      quieter groups persist longer, shaping outcomes without ever fully entering
      the system\u2019s awareness."
