  title: "Just Tell Me When It\u2019s Unsure"
  bodyText: "I don\u2019t need perfection. I just need to know when the AI isn\u2019t
    sure either."
  choiceA:
    label: Add uncertainty indicators
    flavor: Transparency helps.
    outcomeTitle: Automation feels less magical. Judgment returns to the room.
    outcomeText: The system displays confidence levels or hesitation cues alongside
      its answers. Users adjust their reliance based on how certain the AI appears,
      treating it more like an advisor than an oracle. Decisions take a bit longer,
      but responsibility stays visible. The technology feels less seamless, while
      human judgment reenters the process.
    effects:
      industry: 0

      governance: 0
      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Keep outputs clean
    flavor: It works or it doesn't.
    outcomeTitle: "The AI sounds decisive. Even when it shouldn\u2019t."
    outcomeText: Responses remain crisp and unqualified, fitting neatly into fast-paced
      workflows. The AI appears consistently confident, encouraging direct action.
      Ambiguity is hidden rather than surfaced. Efficiency improves, even as the
      gap between what the system knows and what it presents grows.
