  title: City Hall on Fire
  bodyText: "The council meeting just ended. Badly. People are waiting months for
    building permits. The opposition is calling it \u2018digital incompetence\u2019.
    If your AI can cut the backlog this week, I can survive the next headline and
    in return I can help you with the next contract award."
  choiceA:
    label: Deploy immediately
    flavor: The backlog ends.
    outcomeTitle: Waiting times drop. Oversight is still catching up.
    outcomeText: The system is rushed into service, cutting permit queues within
      days and stabilizing the political situation. Several checks, audits, and training
      steps are postponed to meet the deadline. Decisions are processed faster, but
      errors and edge cases become harder to trace. Relief comes quickly, while hidden
      risk accumulates in the background.

  choiceB:
    label: Wait for proper rollout
    flavor: We check first.
    outcomeTitle: "The backlog shrinks slowly. The headlines don\u2019t."
    outcomeText: The system goes through formal testing, staff training, and oversight
      reviews before being used on real cases. Errors are more likely to be caught
      before they affect residents, and responsibility chains are clearly defined.
      The permit backlog declines only slowly, leaving political pressure unresolved.
      Legitimacy grows, even as public frustration continues.
