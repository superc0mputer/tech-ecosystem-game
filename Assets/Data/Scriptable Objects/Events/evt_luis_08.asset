  title: The Boundary
  bodyText: The AI predicts which citizens respond to city services. Based on usage
    patterns. It could adjust response times and reminders to increase turnout in
    specific districts. This stays inside City Hall.
  choiceA:
    label: Disable predictive use for elections
    flavor: We draw a hard line.
    outcomeTitle: The system becomes politically blind. Trust stabilizes.
    outcomeText: "The system stops using behavioral predictions to shape election-related
      communication. All districts receive the same reminders and information, regardless
      of past responsiveness. City officials can point to a firm institutional boundary
      between administration and political outcomes. Engagement becomes flatter,
      while trust in the system\u2019s neutrality becomes easier to sustain."

  choiceB:
    label: Allow limited predictive use
    flavor: "We\u2019re increasing participation."
    outcomeTitle: Turnout shifts subtly. So does the meaning of neutrality.
    outcomeText: The AI continues to adjust timing and emphasis based on which districts
      are most likely to respond. Participation increases in selected areas, even
      though messages remain formally neutral. Because the targeting is invisible,
      some observers begin to describe it as subtle political steering rather than
      simple outreach. Effectiveness rises, while concerns about manipulation grow
      alongside it.
