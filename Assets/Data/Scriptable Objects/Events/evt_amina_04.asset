  title: The Local Vendor Question
  bodyText: "Your deployments for cloud services, consultants and support contracts
    rely on a few big established international partners. Why don\u2019t you integrate
    local companies in your system? They are present - just not selected. I guess
    it\u2019s just all about efficiency and supposed reliability."
  choiceA:
    label: Prioritize local vendors where possible
    flavor: Okay
    outcomeTitle: -1
    outcomeText: Local economies benefit. Coordination slows.
    effects:
      industry: 0
      civilSociety: 0
      governance: 2
      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Local firms are integrated into deployments, even when they lack scale.
      Coordination becomes slower and solutions less uniform. Over time, local expertise
      grows around your system, reducing dependence on a few big actors and embedding
      the AI more deeply into existing economies.
    flavor: Use established global partners
    outcomeTitle: 2
    outcomeText: Deployments scale cleanly. Partners gain leverage.
    effects:
      industry: 0
      civilSociety: 0
      governance: -1
      innovation: 0
