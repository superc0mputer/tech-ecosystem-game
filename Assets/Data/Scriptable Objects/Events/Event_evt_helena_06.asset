  title: The Compliance Ceiling
  bodyText: "Only a handful of companies can meet full AI Act compliance. Mostly
    large players. Smaller firms are falling behind. Some are leaving Europe. If

      civilSociety: 0
      governance: -2
      innovation: 2
  choiceB:
    label: Maintain strict compliance
    flavor: We protect the standard.
    outcome: Safety remains high. The market consolidates around a few giants.
    effects:
      industry: 0
