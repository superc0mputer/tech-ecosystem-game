  title: The Audit Clause
  bodyText: "Regulators want access to our data. Full access. They\u2019re saying
    it\u2019s for \u2018accountability\u2019, but mandatory audits threaten proprietary
    advantage. I think it will cause undue exposure. Once the model is inspectable,
    it\u2019s replicable."
  choiceA:
    label: Resist comprehensive audits.
    flavor: Protect the IP.
    outcomeTitle: Advantage preserved. Political pressure mounts.
    outcomeText: Competitive advantage is preserved, but political pressure mounts.
      The AI is increasingly framed as operating beyond democratic oversight.
    effects:
      industry: 1
      civilSociety: 0
      governance: -2
      innovation: 1
  choiceB:
    label: Accept full audits.
    flavor: Trade secrecy for legitimacy.
    outcomeTitle: Deployment slows. Trust increases.
    outcomeText: "Deployment slows, but trust in the system increases. The AI becomes
      a benchmark for compliance, reducing Victor\u2019s control over proprietary
      boundaries."
