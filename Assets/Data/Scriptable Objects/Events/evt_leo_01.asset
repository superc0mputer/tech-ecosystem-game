  title: Terms Are Suggestions
  bodyText: "Relax. I\u2019ll technically follow your usage policy. I\u2019ll just\u2026
    interpret it creatively. If I win, you\u2019ll say it was vision. If I lose,
    you\u2019ll say it was my fault."
  choiceA:
    label: Look the other way
    flavor: "We don\u2019t police experimentation."
    outcomeTitle: Wild use cases emerge. Your rules become optional in practice.
    outcomeText: "Leo\u2019s startup begins to stretch the system into new territory,
      building features that rely on permissive interpretations of your terms. Early
      results are impressive, and others quietly follow his lead. Over time, success
      depends less on what the rules say and more on who is willing to take the risk.
      Your policies remain intact on paper, while real constraints are set by the
      most ambitious users."

  choiceB:
    label: Enforce terms strictly
    flavor: Rules apply to everyone.
    outcomeTitle: Boundaries hold. Leo calls you "corporate" on Twitter.
    outcomeText: Leo is forced to redesign parts of his product to stay within defined
      limits. Progress slows, and some competitive advantages disappear. The relationship
      cools, publicly and privately, as enforcement makes your role as gatekeeper
      visible. The rules hold and so does the understanding that building on your
      system means building on your terms.
