  title: Who Gets to Build on You
  bodyText: "Your platform is becoming foundational, not just a product - something
    others depend on. You can keep it expensive, tightly controlled, and optimized
    for large clients. Or you can lower barriers so smaller actors - nonprofits,
    startups, public-interest groups - can build on it too, but you have to accept
    less oversight over how it\u2019s used."
  choiceA:
    label: Keep access limited and controlled
    flavor: We approve who builds on the system.
    outcomeTitle: Use cases stay traceable and enforceable. Fewer actors shape the
      ecosystem.
    outcomeText: "The ecosystem remains compact and legible. Use cases are reviewed,
      contracts are enforceable, and responsibility is easier to assign when problems
      arise. A smaller set of actors shapes how the system is used, aligned closely
      with the company\u2019s priorities. Oversight stays strong, while experimentation
      and diversity of application remain constrained."
    effects:
      industry: 1
      civilSociety: 1
      governance: 2
      innovation: -1
  choiceB:
    label: Broaden access deliberately
    flavor: We lower barriers and accept less control.
    outcomeTitle: More groups benefit from the technology. Misuse becomes harder
      to anticipate and correct.
    outcomeText: "A wider range of organizations begins to build on the platform,
      extending its reach into new contexts and communities. Novel applications emerge
      quickly, some aligning with the company\u2019s intent, others less so. The
      benefits spread more broadly, while misuse becomes harder to predict and slower
      to correct. Influence expands, even as direct control diminishes."
    effects:
      industry: -1
      civilSociety: 3
      governance: 0
      innovation: 1
