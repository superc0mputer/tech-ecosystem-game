  title: Synthetic Voices
  bodyText: In that video - it sounds like a famous actor. Your AI can generate voices
    that are indistinguishable. Legality is unclear. Ethics even more so. This can
    be a story about democratized creativity - or about consent disappearing.
  choiceA:
    label: Restrict voice models to licensed use
    flavor: We require explicit permission.
    outcomeTitle: Consent becomes the headline. Creative experimentation narrows.
    outcomeText: Voice generation is tied to verified rights holders and clear consent.
      Public debate centers on ownership and protection rather than novelty. Some
      creative projects become harder to realize, as access is filtered through legal
      and contractual checks. Trust increases, even as the range of experiments becomes
      more constrained.
    effects:

      civilSociety: 1
      governance: 2
      innovation: -2
  choiceB:
    label: Allow open voice synthesis
    flavor: We trust users.
    outcomeTitle: New uses explode. So do uncomfortable questions.
    outcomeText: Voice tools spread quickly into entertainment, parody, and personal
      projects. Boundaries around identity and permission remain undefined, creating
      both excitement and unease. New forms of expression emerge alongside cases
      of impersonation and misuse. Innovation accelerates, while questions about
      consent and accountability grow louder.
