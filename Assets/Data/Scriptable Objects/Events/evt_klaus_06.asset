  title: The First Casualty
  bodyText: Your system was certified. Deployed according to guidelines. A downstream
    operator followed the manual. A decision was delayed. Someone died. This is the
    first real-world death linked to a certified system.
  choiceA:
    label: Suspend deployment and reopen certification
    flavor: We treat this as a systemic failure.
    outcomeTitle: Trust in certification is rebuilt slowly. Your product becomes
      a warning case for the entire sector.
    outcomeText: "All deployments are paused while the failure is investigated and
      certification is reviewed. Regulators, clients, and the public scrutinize how
      the system was approved in the first place. The company becomes a reference
      point for how lethal failures are handled. Trust begins to recover, even as
      the product\u2019s reputation carries lasting scars."

  choiceB:
    label: Treat it as operational misuse
    flavor: We stand by the certification.
    outcomeTitle: Deployment continues. Certification becomes a shield - not a guarantee.
    outcomeText: The certification remains in force, and deployments continue under
      existing guidelines. Responsibility is assigned to the operator, not the system.
      The technology keeps spreading, supported by its formal approval. Certification
      holds legally, even as its meaning shifts from safety assurance to liability
      boundary.
