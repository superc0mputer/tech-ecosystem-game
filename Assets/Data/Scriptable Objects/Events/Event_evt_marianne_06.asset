  title: The Automated Rejection
  bodyText: "An asylum application was rejected. Your AI was used to pre-filter cases.
    The system marked the case as low risk. That meant no full hearing. The applicant
    was deported. Three weeks later, he was killed. This court is examining your
    company\u2019s role."
  choiceA:
    label: Withdraw the pre-filtering feature from asylum use
    flavor: We change where our product may be used.
    effects: governance:2|civil_society:2|industry:-1
    result: Courts regain confidence in human review. Your product loses a major
      public-sector use case.
  choiceB:
    label: Keep the feature, strengthen contractual safeguards
    flavor: We limit our liability, not the product.
    effects: industry:2|governance:-1|civil_society:-1
    result: "Deployments continue. Your company stays legally insulated \u2014 morally
      questioned."
