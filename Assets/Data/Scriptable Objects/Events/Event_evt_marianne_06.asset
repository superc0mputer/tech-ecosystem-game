  title: The Automated Rejection
  bodyText: "An asylum application was rejected. Your AI was used to pre-filter cases.
    The system marked the case as low risk. That meant no full hearing. The applicant
    was deported. Three weeks later, he was killed. This court is examining your
    company\u2019s role."
