  title: Predictable Harm
  bodyText: "Your system could detect risky behavior. Not diagnoses. Patterns. Escalating
    usage. Obsessive loops. Signals that precede breakdowns or worse. You could intervene.
    Slow things down. Show warnings. Redirect. But to do that, you\u2019d have to
    watch users more closely than you do now."
