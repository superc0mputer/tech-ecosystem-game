  title: The Data Revenue Question
  bodyText: "Right now, our only income comes from the product. Subscriptions. Licenses.
    Usage fees. However, given the fierce competition, it is important to have additional
    financial resources. But we also collect something else: how people use the system.
    We can package these usage patterns and sell them to partners - companies, researchers,
    advertisers. No names. No profiles. But it\u2019s still our users\u2019 behavior."
  choiceA:
    label: Sell aggregated usage data
    flavor: We monetize insight.
    effects: industry:2|civil_society:-1
    result: "New revenue streams open fast. Users don\u2019t notice - until they
      do."
  choiceB:
    label: Keep user data internal
    flavor: "We don\u2019t sell behavior."
    effects: civil_society:2|governance:1|industry:-2
    result: Revenue stays simpler and slower. Pricing pressure increases elsewhere.
