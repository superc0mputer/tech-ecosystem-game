  title: Ringfencing the Risk
  bodyText: "One of your largest enterprise clients wants an indemnity clause. If
    your AI causes harm, you cover the downstream liability. It helps close the deal.
    It also means future incidents hit your balance sheet directly. This isn\u2019t
    about blame. It\u2019s about where risk lives."
  choiceA:
    label: Accept broader liability
    flavor: We absorb the risk to grow.
    outcomeTitle: The contract closes quickly. Your company becomes the default backstop
      when things go wrong.
    outcomeText: The agreement is finalized without delay, and the client proceeds
      with deployment. Liability shifts quietly onto your balance sheet, turning
      the company into the first point of response when failures occur. Over time,
      this reshapes internal decision-making, as legal exposure begins to influence
      product design and rollout. Growth accelerates, but risk concentrates in fewer
      hands.

  choiceB:
    label: Limit liability
    flavor: "We don\u2019t underwrite unknown risk."
    outcomeTitle: Some deals fall through. Future exposure becomes easier to price
      and insure.
    outcomeText: Negotiations take longer, and some clients walk away in favor of
      more permissive vendors. The deals that remain are clearer in scope, with responsibilities
      defined before deployment. Financial exposure becomes easier to model and insure,
      even as short-term revenue suffers. The system grows more cautiously, shaped
      by boundaries that make future failures easier to contain.
