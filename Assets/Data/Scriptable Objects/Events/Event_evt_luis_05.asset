  title: The Protest
  bodyText: "People are outside City Hall. They\u2019re holding signs. The AI prioritizes
    service requests. Street repairs, housing complaints, welfare appointments. The
    system kept pushing one neighborhood down the list. Now they\u2019re here. With
    cameras."
  choiceA:
    label: Suspend the AI immediately
    flavor: We stop automated prioritization.
    effects: civil_society:3|governance:1|industry:-1
    result: "The protest dissolves. Manual processing returns \u2014 slowly and expensively."
  choiceB:
    label: Defend the system publicly
    flavor: The AI is neutral.
    effects: industry:3|civil_society:-1
    result: Efficiency holds. The protest becomes a political symbol.
