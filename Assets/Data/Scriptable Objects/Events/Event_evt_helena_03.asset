  title: Strategic Dependence
  bodyText: "When something breaks, they call Brussels. Even if the infrastructure
    isn\u2019t European. Your AI depends on non-EU chips and cloud layers. That\u2019s
    efficient. It\u2019s also a political liability. If I push for localization,
    I\u2019m accused of protectionism. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019m blamed for dependency."
  choiceA:
    label: Commit to EU-based infrastructure
    flavor: We reduce strategic risk.
    effects: governance:2|industry:-1
    result: Resilience improves. Costs rise, innovation slows in Europe.
  choiceB:
    label: Keep global infrastructure
    flavor: We stay competitive.
    effects: industry:2|governance:-1
    result: Growth remains strong. Control sits outside democratic reach.
