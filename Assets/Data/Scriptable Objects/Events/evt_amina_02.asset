  title: Whose Standards?
  bodyText: "These compliance standards were written in Brussels and Silicon Valley.
    They don\u2019t reflect local risk. What\u2019s safe here can be harmful elsewhere."
  choiceA:
    label: Adapt standards regionally
    flavor: We accept uneven rules.
    outcomeTitle: Local relevance grows, but compliance fragments.
    outcomeText: Risk thresholds and safeguards are adjusted to local political and
      social conditions. Certain harms are mitigated more effectively on the ground.
      Compliance becomes fragmented and harder to explain to regulators and investors.
      Your global oversight narrative weakens as local relevance increases.

  choiceB:
    label: Enforce one global standard
    flavor: We apply the same rules everywhere.
    outcomeTitle: Oversight stays orderly. Hidden harm persists.
    outcomeText: Oversight remains orderly and predictable. Audits run smoothly,
      and compliance can be defended with confidence across borders. In some regions,
      however, the system hesitates or shuts down where no alternatives exist. The
      harm does not register as a violation - only as something the standard was
      never designed to see.
