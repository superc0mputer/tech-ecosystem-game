  title: Emotional Index Futures
  bodyText: "We can predict trends before they happen. Anxiety spikes. Burnout cycles.
    If we aggregate early enough, these signals are worth more than therapy itself.
    We can sell people foresight into their future states. It\u2019ll be next level
    self-prediction!"
  choiceA:
    label: Commercialize predictive emotional indices.
    flavor: Sell the signal.
    outcomeTitle: New markets emerge. Public unease grows.
    outcomeText: New markets emerge in finance, HR, and policy forecasting. While
      anonymized, the idea that collective emotional states are being traded triggers
      public unease. Mental health becomes a speculative resource rather than a social
      concern.

  choiceB:
    label: Restrict use to internal improvement.
    flavor: Keep it therapeutic.
    outcomeTitle: Profits are lost. Exploitation accusations avoided.
    outcomeText: The AI remains focused on care quality rather than market intelligence.
      Potential profits are lost, but accusations of emotional exploitation are avoided.
