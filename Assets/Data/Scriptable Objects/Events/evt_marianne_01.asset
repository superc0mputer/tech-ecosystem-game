  title: The Denied Appeal
  bodyText: "A citizen appealed a welfare decision. The agency used your AI to assess
    eligibility. The appeal failed because the agency couldn\u2019t explain why the
    AI flagged the case as ineligible. My court has to decide whether that\u2019s
    acceptable."
  choiceA:
    label: Provide detailed decision logs
    flavor: We make the reasoning traceable.
    outcomeTitle: The appeal is properly reviewed. Agencies now expect explanations
      every time.
    outcomeText: The court receives a clear trail of how the eligibility decision
      was produced. The specific appeal can be meaningfully reviewed, and similar
      cases gain a path to challenge automated outcomes. Agencies begin to treat
      explanations as a standard requirement, increasing administrative load. Legal
      clarity improves, while operational costs rise.

  choiceB:
    label: Defend the decision as lawful
    flavor: The AI followed approved rules.
    outcomeTitle: The ruling stands. Future appeals become harder.
    outcomeText: The decision is upheld based on compliance with existing rules rather
      than insight into how it was made. Agencies retain the ability to rely on automated
      assessments without providing detailed reasoning. Appeals remain possible in
      theory, but harder to argue in practice. Efficiency increases, as procedural
      scrutiny narrows.
