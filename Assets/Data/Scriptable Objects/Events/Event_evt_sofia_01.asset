  title: AI Art Wins a Prize
  bodyText: "An AI-generated piece just won a major design award. The judges didn\u2019t
    know, but no rules were broken. Artists are furious. The jury is embarrassed.
    And everyone\u2019s asking the same question: Is this a story about innovation
    or about creative work being quietly displaced?"
  choiceA:
    label: Frame it as a breakthrough
    flavor: We highlight what the technology enables.
    outcome: The headline celebrates progress. Human creators feel written out of
      the story.
    effects:
      industry: 0
      civilSociety: -1
      governance: 0
      innovation: 2
  choiceB:
    label: Push for transparency in creative contests
    flavor: We call for clearer boundaries.
    outcome: "The debate becomes more nuanced. The hype cools \u2014 so does momentum."
    effects:
      industry: 0
      civilSociety: 0
      governance: 2
