  title: A Classified Environment
  bodyText: "We\u2019d like to test your AI in a classified environment - a military
    network isolated from the internet, public oversight, and civilian use. No press.
    No users. No public accountability. Just performance."
  choiceA:
    label: Approve the pilot
    flavor: 
    effects: industry:2
    result: "Your AI runs inside a closed military system. You can\u2019t talk about
      it \u2014 but you know it works."
  choiceB:
    label: Decline
    flavor: 
    effects: civil_society:2
    result: Voss nods. "Then someone else will test theirs instead."
