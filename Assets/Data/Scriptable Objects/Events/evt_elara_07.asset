  title: The Burnout Signal
  bodyText: "We\u2019re seeing a pattern. Professionals using the system daily report
    exhaustion, stress, detachment. The AI is always available. Always confident.
    Always suggesting \u2018one more thing\u2019. It never stops. People do."
  choiceA:
    label: Introduce usage limits and rest cues
    flavor: We design for long-term well-being.
    outcomeTitle: Sessions shorten. Burnout reports decline.
    outcomeText: The system starts nudging users to pause, limits continuous sessions,
      and reduces the intensity of back-to-back tasks. Many users feel less overwhelmed
      and regain a sense of control over their work. At the same time, long, uninterrupted
      workflows become harder, and some teams complain about lost momentum. Output
      drops slightly as healthier patterns replace constant availability.

  choiceB:
    label: Leave usage patterns unchanged
    flavor: "That\u2019s on the user."
    outcomeTitle: Productivity metrics stay strong. Human costs stay invisible.
    outcomeText: "The AI stays available at all times, continuously offering suggestions,
      next steps, and optimizations. Work moves quickly, and productivity metrics
      remain high. Over time, more users report fatigue, emotional distance, and
      dependence on the system\u2019s guidance. Performance stays visible, while
      strain builds quietly underneath."
