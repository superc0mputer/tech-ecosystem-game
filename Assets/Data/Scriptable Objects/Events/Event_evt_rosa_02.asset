  title: The Missing Document
  bodyText: "Your system is reviewing applications for emergency housing assistance.
    It flags them often as incomplete. One missing document. A payslip. A lease.
    A proof of address. People who are stable can upload it tomorrow. People who
    are already losing their home often can\u2019t."
  choiceA:
    label: Allow provisional approval
    flavor: We give time to fix errors.
    outcome: More households remain eligible while documents are completed. Case
      handling becomes slower and more complex.

      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Enforce strict completeness
    flavor: "We decide based on what\u2019s submitted."
    outcome: Processing stays fast and predictable. Applicants with unstable situations
      drop out first.
