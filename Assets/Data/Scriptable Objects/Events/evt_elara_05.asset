  title: One Interface Fits All?
  bodyText: "Professionals want control. Casual users want simplicity. One interface
    can\u2019t serve both well."
  choiceA:
    label: Offer multiple modes
    flavor: We design for diversity.
    outcomeTitle: Users feel better served. Maintenance complexity increases.
    outcomeText: Separate modes are introduced for power users and for casual users,
      each with different levels of control and guidance. People can work in ways
      that better match their skills and needs. At the same time, every update now
      has to support multiple versions of the interface. User satisfaction rises,
      while design and testing effort grows.

  choiceB:
    label: Standardize the experience
    flavor: We pick one.
    outcomeTitle: The product stays clean. Some users feel ignored.
    outcomeText: A single interface is chosen and refined, keeping the product easier
      to maintain and explain. Development moves faster, and support becomes simpler.
      Some users find the experience either too complex or too limited for their
      needs. Clarity improves, while fit becomes narrower.
