  title: "It\u2019s Just a Joke"
  bodyText: "Fake videos. Private people. Colleagues. Teachers. Ex-partners. Most
    are framed as humor. But some targets are losing jobs. There\u2019s no single
    victim yet. Just a story forming."
  choiceA:
    label: Introduce basic safeguards
    flavor: We slow misuse.
    outcomeTitle: Some abuse is flagged. Creators complain about friction.
    outcomeText: Certain forms of abusive or deceptive content are flagged before
      they spread widely. Some harmful cases are intercepted, while others slip through.
      Creators encounter new limits that add friction to fast-moving trends. Harm
      is reduced in specific instances, even as complaints about overreach and false
      positives increase.

  choiceB:
    label: Leave moderation to platforms
    flavor: "We\u2019re not the internet police."
    outcomeTitle: Creative freedom stays intact. Targets are told to log off.
    outcomeText: The tools remain open and flexible, with responsibility for content
      pushed to downstream platforms. Moderation varies widely, depending on where
      material is posted and who reports it. For some targets, recourse comes slowly
      or not at all. Creative activity continues, while the burden of managing harm
      shifts away from your company.
