  title: Did You Write This?
  bodyText: "Schools are panicking. Teachers can\u2019t tell what\u2019s human anymore.
    Detection doesn\u2019t work. Students are being accused. Some unfairly. Some
    correctly. This isn\u2019t about cheating. It\u2019s about whether your product
    becomes part of assessment - or something institutions actively try to block."
  choiceA:
    label: Make the product incompatible with exams
    flavor: We deliberately block use in exams.
    effects: governance:2|civil_society:1|industry:-2
    result: Institutions stop treating your AI as an assessment threat. Students
      continue using it outside formal evaluation.
  choiceB:
    label: Make the product compatible with assessment
    flavor: We design features for grading.
    effects: industry:1|innovation:1|governance:-2|civil_society:-1
    result: Adoption accelerates in education. Traditional notions of authorship
      erode.
