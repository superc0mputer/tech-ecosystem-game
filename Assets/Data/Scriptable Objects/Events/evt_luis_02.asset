  title: Budget Committee
  bodyText: "This AI would replace overtime hours in our call center. Fewer night
    shifts. Fewer temp contracts. But I can\u2019t pay for every safeguard and audit
    you\u2019re offering. Is there a version that just answers citizen emails automatically?"
  choiceA:
    label: Offer a cheaper version
    flavor: Savings first.
    outcomeTitle: The city saves money. Some requests are mishandled.
    outcomeText: The city adopts a lightweight version that handles large volumes
      of routine messages at low cost. Response times improve, and staffing expenses
      drop. At the same time, edge cases and unusual requests are more likely to
      be misrouted or misunderstood. Efficiency rises, while the burden of correcting
      mistakes shifts to citizens and staff.

      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Stick to full safeguards
    flavor: Safety isn't optional.
    outcomeTitle: Costs stay high. Automation is limited.
    outcomeText: The system is deployed with full auditing, escalation paths, and
      quality controls, increasing operational costs. Fewer inquiries are automated,
      but those that are receive more reliable handling. At the same time budget
      pressure limits how widely the technology can be rolled out. Oversight remains
      strong, while financial constraints slow expansion.
