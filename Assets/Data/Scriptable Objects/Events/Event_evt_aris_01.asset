  title: Who Gets a Voice?
  bodyText: "Your feedback channels are clean. But they\u2019re not neutral. Complaints
    require time, literacy, stability. The people most affected rarely submit them.
    If you wait for feedback, you\u2019ll only hear from the comfortable."
  choiceA:
    label: Actively seek feedback from marginalized users
    flavor: We go where silence is.
    effects: civil_society:2
    result: Blind spots shrink. Research costs increase.
  choiceB:
    label: Rely on existing feedback mechanisms
    flavor: We listen to who speaks up.
    effects: industry:2
    result: Signals remain easy to process. Some harms never surface.
