  title: The Boundary
  bodyText: The AI predicts which citizens respond to city services. Based on usage
    patterns. It could adjust response times and reminders to increase turnout in
    specific districts. This stays inside City Hall.
  choiceA:
    label: Disable predictive use for elections
    flavor: We draw a hard line.
    effects: governance:3|civil_society:1|industry:-1
    result: The system becomes politically blind. Trust stabilizes.
  choiceB:
    label: Allow limited predictive use
    flavor: "We\u2019re increasing participation."
    effects: industry:2|governance:-1
    result: Turnout shifts subtly. So does the meaning of neutrality.
