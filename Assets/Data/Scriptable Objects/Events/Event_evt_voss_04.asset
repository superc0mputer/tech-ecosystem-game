  title: Operational Changes
  bodyText: Our engineers are requesting changes to the system. They want to remove
    explainability layers from the decision loop. Each additional check adds latency.
    In combat systems, milliseconds matter. Delays cost lives.
  choiceA:
    label: Remove some safeguards
    flavor: 
    effects: industry:2|governance:-1
    result: The AI reacts faster. Later reviews become harder to conduct.
  choiceB:
    label: Keep safeguards
    flavor: 
    effects: governance:2|industry:-1
    result: The system remains auditable. The military marks it as "operationally
      limited."
