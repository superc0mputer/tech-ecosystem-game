  title: Unreadable Evidence
  bodyText: "This is from an active case. A citizen is suing a public agency over
    an automated decision. These are your system logs. These logs are accurate, but
    they\u2019re written for machines - not for courts. If no one can explain them,
    they\u2019re not evidence. They\u2019re noise."
  choiceA:
    label: Reformat evidence for courts
    flavor: We translate the logs.
    outcomeTitle: The case proceeds. Your engineers lose weeks making the system
      legible.
    outcomeText: Your company produces court-ready explanations, timelines, and causal
      chains from the raw system logs. Judges and lawyers can meaningfully assess
      what the AI did and why. But engineering and legal teams are pulled into ongoing
      case support, slowing product development and increasing liability exposure.
      Transparency improves, while operational and legal costs rise.

  choiceB:
    label: Submit raw technical data
    flavor: This is industry standard.
    outcomeTitle: The submission is formally accepted. The case stalls anyway.
    outcomeText: Your company meets disclosure obligations by providing full technical
      records without interpretation. Development continues uninterrupted, and sensitive
      design details remain harder to extract. Courts and plaintiffs struggle to
      use the data, slowing or weakening cases. Operational freedom increases, even
      as the justice system loses leverage over the technology.
