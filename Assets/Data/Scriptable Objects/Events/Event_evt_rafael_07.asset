  title: The Rebound Effect
  bodyText: "Our efficiency work paid off. Energy per request is down. Costs dropped.
    Usage didn\u2019t just grow. It exploded. Because the system is cheaper and faster,
    people use it more. For things they wouldn\u2019t have used it for before. Total
    energy use is now higher than before the optimization. This is just what happens
    when something gets better."
  choiceA:
    label: Cap usage despite efficiency gains
    flavor: We limit growth deliberately.
    effects: governance:2|civil_society:1|industry:-2
    result: Total resource use stabilizes. Customers accuse you of artificial scarcity.
  choiceB:
    label: Let demand scale freely
    flavor: Efficiency justifies growth.
    effects: industry:2|innovation:1|governance:-2
    result: Adoption surges. Infrastructure strain accelerates again.
