  title: Who Owns the Data?
  bodyText: "Legal flagged an ambiguity. Users assume their conversations are theirs,
    but once the model processes them, they\u2019re no longer raw data - they\u2019re
    patterns extracted by our system. That\u2019s our IP. If we don\u2019t define
    ownership now, someone else will. Regulators. Courts. Or worse - users."
  choiceA:
    label: Define conversations as company-owned derivatives.
    flavor: Secure the asset.
    outcomeTitle: Monetization accelerates. Users lose control.
    outcomeText: The company establishes strong IP claims over conversational data
      and derived insights, enabling licensing deals and long-term asset valuation.
      Monetization accelerates, and Victor gains leverage in external negotiations.
      However, users lose practical control over their disclosures, and civil society
      groups begin to argue that emotional labor is being enclosed as corporate property.

  choiceB:
    label: Acknowledge ongoing user ownership.
    flavor: Limit the claim.
    outcomeTitle: Trust stabilizes. Financial power weakens.
    outcomeText: Ownership boundaries restrict large-scale data licensing. The system
      becomes easier to defend ethically and legally, but Victor warns that without
      exclusive assets, the platform risks becoming replaceable. Trust stabilises,
      financial power does not.
