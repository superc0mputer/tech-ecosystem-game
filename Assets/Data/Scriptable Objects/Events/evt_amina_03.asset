  title: Jobs That Never Arrive
  bodyText: 'Your system is everywhere now: Hospitals, ministries, universities.
    People rely on it. When it was announced, there was talk of opportunity. Of jobs.
    Of growth. But the development stayed where it always was. Here, people learned
    how to use your AI. They never learned how to build it.'
  choiceA:
    label: Invest in local AI teams
    flavor: We build more than markets.
    outcomeTitle: Local expertise grows slowly. Decisions diversify.
    outcomeText: Local teams take time to form, and early progress is uneven. Hiring
      and training slow releases, and some engineers leave again for better-paid
      roles elsewhere. Others stay and begin to contribute cautiously, raising issues
      that were never part of earlier discussions. Over time, parts of the system
      start reflecting local priorities, even if only at the margins. The product
      evolves more slowly, but decisions are no longer entirely imported.

  choiceB:
    label: Keep development centralized
    flavor: We focus where expertise already exists.
    outcomeTitle: Updates are fast. Local dependency deepens.
    outcomeText: Development remains fast and tightly coordinated, with clear ownership
      and a unified roadmap. Improvements reach users quickly, but always as finished
      products, designed elsewhere. Locally, the AI is treated as infrastructure
      rather than opportunity. It becomes something people depend on, but cannot
      influence or grow with. Economic benefits concentrate where development happens,
      while usage spreads outward without creating new pathways.
