  title: Secondary Markets
  bodyText: "We\u2019re sitting on more intelligence than we use. Why sell one system
    when we can sell twenty specialized versions? Let others build on our work for
    a fee."
  choiceA:
    label: Launch the data and model exchange.
    flavor: Let the market scale it.
    outcomeTitle: Ecosystem thrives. Accountability diffuses.
    outcomeText: A thriving ecosystem emerges, but accountability becomes more difficult
      to manage. When harms occur, responsibility is diffused across licensees. Regulators
      struggle to trace liability, and public oversight weakens.
    effects:
      industry: 2
      civilSociety: 0
      governance: -1
      innovation: 1
  choiceB:
    label: Keep models centralized.
    flavor: Maintain control.
    outcomeTitle: Oversight remains clear. Innovation slows.
    outcomeText: Oversight remains clear and defensible, but innovation slows. External
      developers are excluded, and Victor argues that value is being artificially
      constrained.
    effects:
      industry: -1
      civilSociety: 1
      governance: 2
      innovation: -1
