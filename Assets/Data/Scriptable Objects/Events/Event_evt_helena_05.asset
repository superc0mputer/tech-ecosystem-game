  title: The Moving Target
  bodyText: I can certify what exists today. Not what your system becomes tomorrow.
    If I allow continuous learning, oversight weakens. If I freeze models, I approve
    systems I know will age badly.
  choiceA:
    label: Accept ongoing regulatory oversight
    flavor: We regulate the process.
    outcome: Systems evolve under supervision. Innovation continues - but ships slower.
    effects:
      industry: 0
      civilSociety: 0
      governance: 2
      innovation: -1
  choiceB:
    label: Freeze approved versions
    flavor: We regulate stability.
    outcome: Certification stays simple. The system falls behind its own research.
    effects:
      industry: 0
      civilSociety: 0
      governance: 1
      innovation: -2
