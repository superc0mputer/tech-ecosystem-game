  title: The Prototype
  bodyText: "I\u2019ve got a prototype. It works - mostly. It\u2019s not stable enough
    for users yet."
  choiceA:
    label: Give her time to refine it
    flavor: Let her cook.
    outcomeTitle: The prototype improves. Nothing ships this sprint.
    outcomeText: The prototype becomes more robust and better understood through
      further testing. Promising edge cases turn into reliable behavior. The roadmap
      slips for this cycle, and no visible feature reaches users yet. Depth improves,
      while momentum pauses.

  choiceB:
    label: Turn it into a feature now
    flavor: "We\u2019ll fix it later."
    outcomeTitle: Users get something new. Engineers quietly worry.
    outcomeText: The prototype is pushed into production and marketed as a new capability.
      Users start experimenting with it, even as limitations and bugs surface. Development
      moves fast, but technical debt begins to accumulate. Progress is visible, while
      confidence inside the team erodes.
