  title: The Automatic Sanction
  bodyText: "Missed appointments trigger sanctions. The system assumes non-compliance.
    Sometimes it\u2019s a missed bus. Sometimes a sick child."
  choiceA:
    label: Add a grace period
    flavor: We assume good faith first.
    outcomeTitle: Fewer benefits are cut automatically. Abuse becomes harder to detect.
    outcomeText: Missed appointments no longer trigger immediate penalties, giving
      recipients time to explain or correct the record. Many avoid losing support
      over minor disruptions. At the same time, enforcement becomes less immediate,
      and some cases of non-compliance take longer to surface. The system grows more
      forgiving, even as oversight becomes less sharp.

      governance: 0
      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Enforce sanctions immediately
    flavor: Rules must be predictable.
    outcomeTitle: The system stays strict and fast. Small failures escalate quickly.
    outcomeText: Sanctions are applied as soon as a rule is broken, keeping procedures
      clear and efficient. Case volumes stay manageable, and compliance signals remain
      strong. Small setbacks quickly become formal violations. The system remains
      orderly, even as individual situations are less able to interrupt its flow.
