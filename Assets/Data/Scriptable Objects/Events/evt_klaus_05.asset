  title: Assumptions in the Manual
  bodyText: "Your safety analysis assumes trained users. Stable environments. Proper
    supervision. I don\u2019t certify intentions. I certify what happens when assumptions
    break. You can redesign for misuse. Or define it out of scope."
  choiceA:
    label: Design for misuse and misinterpretation
    flavor: We assume real-world behavior.
    outcomeTitle: The system tolerates mistakes better. Complexity and cost increase.
    outcomeText: The system is modified to handle common errors, misuse, and ambiguous
      inputs more safely. Some failure modes are absorbed by design rather than passed
      to users. Engineering effort and compliance costs rise as edge cases move into
      scope. Robustness improves, while simplicity and speed decline.

  choiceB:
    label: Limit responsibility to documented use
    flavor: We certify intended operation.
    outcomeTitle: "Certification is straightforward. Harm outside assumptions becomes
      someone else\u2019s problem."
    outcomeText: Approval is based on how the system performs under defined conditions
      and trained operation. Development and documentation stay focused, keeping
      certification manageable. When the technology is used outside those boundaries,
      consequences fall on operators rather than the product. Clarity increases,
      even as real-world risk shifts outward.
