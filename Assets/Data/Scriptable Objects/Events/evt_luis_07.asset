  title: Targeted Visibility
  bodyText: Our AI sends city notifications. Deadlines, service updates, reminders.
    It started prioritizing districts with low engagement. Turnout improves there.
    No one tells people who to vote for. But the timing helps me.
  choiceA:
    label: Standardize communication citywide
    flavor: We make it strictly neutral.
    outcomeTitle: Messaging becomes neutral. Political advantages flatten out.
    outcomeText: Notifications are delivered uniformly, regardless of engagement
      or political sensitivity. Residents receive the same information at the same
      time, making the system easier to defend as neutral infrastructure. Targeted
      turnout effects disappear, and so do some of the gains in responsiveness. Legitimacy
      strengthens, while influence becomes harder to exercise.
    effects:
      industry: -1
      civilSociety: 2
      governance: 2
      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Keep optimizing engagement
    flavor: "It\u2019s still public service."
    outcomeTitle: Engagement rises where it matters. So do questions about fairness.
    outcomeText: The system continues to time and target messages where they produce
      the strongest response. Certain districts become more active and reachable,
      while others remain less visible. Public service metrics improve, but the pattern
      of influence becomes uneven. Effectiveness rises, even as the line between
      service delivery and political advantage grows thinner.
    effects:
      industry: 2
      civilSociety: -1
      governance: -1
      innovation: 0
