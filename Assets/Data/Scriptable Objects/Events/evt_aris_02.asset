  title: Global by Name
  bodyText: "You\u2019re calling this a global product. But you test it where users
    are predictable and well-resourced. When it fails elsewhere, you call it \u2018unexpected
    behavior\u2019."
  choiceA:
    label: Design for diverse real-world conditions
    flavor: We treat global use seriously.
    outcomeTitle: The system becomes more robust across contexts. Development slows
      and assumptions are challenged.
    outcomeText: Testing expands into environments with unstable connectivity, different
      usage patterns, and fewer safeguards. The system becomes more resilient across
      contexts, but familiar assumptions no longer hold. Edge cases move to the center
      of development, slowing iteration and complicating validation. Reliability
      improves broadly, while simplicity is gradually lost.

      innovation: -1
  choiceB:
    label: Focus on primary markets first
    flavor: We scale where reliability is highest.
    outcomeTitle: Performance stays strong in core markets. Failures elsewhere are
      normalized.
    outcomeText: "Development remains optimized for well-understood users and controlled
      conditions. Performance stays strong where infrastructure and expectations
      align with design assumptions. Failures outside core markets are treated as
      exceptions rather than signals. The product scales efficiently, even as its
      claim to being \u201Cglobal\u201D becomes increasingly aspirational."
