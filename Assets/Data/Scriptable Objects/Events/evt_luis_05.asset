  title: The Protest
  bodyText: "People are outside City Hall. They\u2019re holding signs. The AI prioritizes
    service requests. Street repairs, housing complaints, welfare appointments. The
    system kept pushing one neighborhood down the list. Now they\u2019re here. With
    cameras."
  choiceA:
    label: Suspend the AI immediately
    flavor: We stop automated prioritization.
    outcomeTitle: "The protest dissolves. Manual processing returns \u2014 slowly
      and expensively."
    outcomeText: Automated prioritization is switched off, and casework returns to
      human queues. The visible trigger for the protest disappears, easing public
      tension. Service slows as staff work through backlogs by hand, and costs rise.
      Trust recovers in the short term, even as administrative strain grows.

  choiceB:
    label: Defend the system publicly
    flavor: The AI is neutral.
    outcomeTitle: Efficiency holds. The protest becomes a political symbol.
    outcomeText: The city stands by the algorithm and keeps it running. Processing
      remains fast and predictable for most requests. The protest gains media attention,
      reframing the AI as a political issue rather than a technical one. Efficiency
      holds, while legitimacy becomes contested.
