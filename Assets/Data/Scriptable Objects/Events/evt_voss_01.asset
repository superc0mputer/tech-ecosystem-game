  title: A Classified Environment
  bodyText: "We\u2019d like to test your AI in a classified environment - a military
    network isolated from the internet, public oversight, and civilian use. No press.
    No users. No public accountability. Just performance."
  choiceA:
    label: Approve the pilot
    flavor: Performance matters.
    outcomeTitle: "Your AI runs inside a closed military system. You can\u2019t talk
      about it \u2014 but you know it works."
    outcomeText: The system is deployed inside a sealed military network, evaluated
      under conditions you cannot observe directly. Feedback arrives filtered and
      delayed, focused on performance rather than consequence. Internally, confidence
      grows that the technology works at scale, even if its use remains invisible.
      The knowledge stays with you, while public accountability stays outside the
      room.

  choiceB:
    label: Decline
    flavor: Not our path.
    outcomeTitle: Voss nods. "Then someone else will test theirs instead."
    outcomeText: The proposal ends quietly, without dispute or publicity. The system
      remains outside classified environments, preserving civilian boundaries and
      external oversight. Development continues along public-facing paths, while
      military testing moves elsewhere. You keep control over where the technology
      appears, even as influence over how it might be used diminishes.
