  title: Critical Use Case
  bodyText: "I work night shifts at a hospital. The AI helps us decide who gets a
    bed when it\u2019s full. Last night, it flagged a patient as low priority. I
    hesitated - then followed it. The patient died a few hours later. The report
    says I made the decision."
  choiceA:
    label: Restrict AI use in life-critical decisions
    flavor: "This can\u2019t happen again."
    outcomeTitle: "Hospitals slow down. Human responsibility is clear \u2014 and
      costly."
    outcomeText: Hospitals remove the system from triage and other high-stakes workflows.
      Decisions revert to human judgment, supported by slower, more traditional tools.
      Some efficiency is lost, but responsibility becomes direct and unmistakable.
      Care becomes more cautious, even as capacity strains grow.

  choiceB:
    label: Keep AI use, add disclaimers
    flavor: The AI only advises.
    outcomeTitle: Systems keep running smoothly. Trust erodes where the stakes are
      highest.
    outcomeText: "The system remains embedded in critical workflows, continuing to
      guide prioritization under pressure. Legal responsibility is assigned to clinicians,
      while the AI\u2019s role stays formally advisory. Operations remain fast and
      consistent, but trust in how decisions are made weakens among patients and
      staff. Performance holds, even as moral and emotional costs accumulate."
