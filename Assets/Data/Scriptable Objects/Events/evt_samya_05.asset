  title: One Model to Rule Them All
  bodyText: We could merge several systems into one large model. Shared representations.
    Cleaner architecture. But if it fails, everything fails.
  choiceA:
    label: Merge the models
    flavor: Go big.
    outcomeTitle: Capabilities expand. Single points of failure emerge.
    outcomeText: The separate systems are merged into a single, shared core. Knowledge
      flows more freely, and capabilities that once lived apart now reinforce each
      other. New features become easier to build, and the product feels more unified.
      At the same time, errors and blind spots no longer stay isolated. When the
      system stumbles, it does so everywhere at once. Power concentrates, and so
      does the risk.

      innovation: 2
  choiceB:
    label: Keep systems separate
    flavor: Redundancy matters.
    outcomeTitle: Systems stay stable. Progress fragments.
    outcomeText: Each model continues to evolve on its own, carrying its own strengths
      and weaknesses. Failures remain local, and no single bug can bring everything
      down. But insights and improvements move more slowly between systems, and some
      opportunities are missed. The architecture remains resilient, even as its full
      potential stays fragmented.
