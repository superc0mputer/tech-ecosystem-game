  title: The Decision Was the System
  bodyText: Agencies are changing how they talk to people. When someone asks why
    they were rejected, the answer is always the same. The system decided. Not the
    agency. Not a caseworker. Your product.
  choiceA:
    label: Force clients to retain visible responsibility
    flavor: No decision without a human name attached.
    outcome: Accountability returns to institutions. Some clients resist or delay
      adoption.
    effects:
      industry: -1
      civilSociety: 2
      governance: 2
      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Allow full delegation to the system
    flavor: Clients choose how they use it.
    outcome: Your system becomes the final authority. Responsibility dissolves upward.
