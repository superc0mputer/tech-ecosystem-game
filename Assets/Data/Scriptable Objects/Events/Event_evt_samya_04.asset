  title: Technical Debt
  bodyText: "This part of the code was written fast. It works - but barely. If we
    don\u2019t refactor now, every new feature gets harder."
  choiceA:
    label: Pause features and refactor
    flavor: We clean it up.
    outcome: The system becomes more robust. Roadmaps slip quietly.
    effects:
      industry: -1
      civilSociety: 0
      governance: 0
      innovation: 2
  choiceB:
    label: Ship anyway
    flavor: "We\u2019ll deal with it later."
    outcome: Progress looks fast. Complexity piles up.
