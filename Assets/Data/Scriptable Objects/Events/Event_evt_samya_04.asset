  title: Technical Debt
  bodyText: "This part of the code was written fast. It works - but barely. If we
    don\u2019t refactor now, every new feature gets harder."
  choiceA:
    label: Pause features and refactor
    flavor: We clean it up.
    effects: innovation:2|industry:-1
    result: The system becomes more robust. Roadmaps slip quietly.
  choiceB:
    label: Ship anyway
    flavor: "We\u2019ll deal with it later."
    effects: industry:2|innovation:-1
    result: Progress looks fast. Complexity piles up.
