  title: Pace Check
  bodyText: "The report shows rising burnout among engineers. But deadlines don\u2019t
    care how tired people are. Markets don\u2019t either."
  choiceA:
    label: Push the timeline.
    flavor: We deliver.
    outcomeTitle: Velocity holds. Creativity thins at the edges.
    outcomeText: "Deadlines are met, and releases arrive on schedule. The system
      continues to improve, but changes become smaller and safer. Your engineers
      rely more on existing patterns and avoid risky ideas that might slow things
      down. Burnout doesn\u2019t cause immediate failure, but it narrows the range
      of solutions the team is willing to explore. Progress remains visible, while
      originality gradually fades from the roadmap."

  choiceB:
    label: Slow down.
    flavor: We protect the team.
    outcomeTitle: Marcus nods once. "Rest is expensive."
    outcomeText: Development slows, and some milestones are quietly revised. But
      your engineers recover enough space to question assumptions and revisit earlier
      design decisions. So, experiments become more ambitious, but results arrive
      later and less predictably. From the outside, momentum appears to weaken. Inside
      the team, however, the system begins to evolve in ways that are harder to measure
      but more resilient over time.
