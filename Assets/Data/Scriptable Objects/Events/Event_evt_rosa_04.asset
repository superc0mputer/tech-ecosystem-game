  title: The Feature Clients Ask For
  bodyText: "Several agencies are asking for a \u2018risk flag\u2019. One indicator.
    Red or green. It simplifies casework. It also becomes the decision."
  choiceA:
    label: Refuse to build a single-score flag
    flavor: "We don\u2019t reduce people to one signal."
    effects: civil_society:2|industry:-1
    result: Decisions remain nuanced. Some clients look for simpler tools elsewhere.
  choiceB:
    label: Offer the feature with disclaimers
    flavor: We trust professionals to use it responsibly.
    effects: industry:2|civil_society:-1
    result: Adoption increases. The flag quietly dominates outcomes.
