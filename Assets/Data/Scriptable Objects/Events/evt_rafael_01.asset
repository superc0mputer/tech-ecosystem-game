  title: Where to Build the Data Center
  bodyText: Site A runs mostly on solar. Energy is cheap and clean - but water is
    scarce. Cooling will compete with agriculture. Site B has abundant water and
    existing cooling infrastructure. But the grid relies heavily on coal and gas.
  choiceA:
    label: Build at the solar-powered site
    flavor: We optimize for clean energy.
    outcomeTitle: Emissions stay low. Water usage becomes a bottleneck.
    outcomeText: The data center draws most of its power from solar, sharply reducing
      carbon emissions and insulating the company from volatile energy prices. As
      demand grows, however, cooling systems place increasing strain on a region
      already short on water. Local farmers, municipalities, and regulators begin
      to push back. The company gains a green reputation, while physical resource
      limits start to cap how far and how fast it can expand.

  choiceB:
    label: Build at the water-secure site
    flavor: We optimize for reliability and scale.
    outcomeTitle: The system scales smoothly. Environmental scrutiny grows.
    outcomeText: Reliable water and established infrastructure allow the facility
      to scale without major technical hurdles. Performance, uptime, and expansion
      plans remain predictable as the system grows. The electricity grid, however,
      remains heavily fossil-fueled, increasing emissions and drawing criticism from
      environmental groups and policymakers. Growth accelerates, even as the project
      becomes harder to justify in climate and sustainability debates.
