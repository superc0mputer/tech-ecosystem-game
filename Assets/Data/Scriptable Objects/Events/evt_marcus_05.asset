  title: The Data Revenue Question
  bodyText: "Right now, our only income comes from the product. Subscriptions. Licenses.
    Usage fees. However, given the fierce competition, it is important to have additional
    financial resources. But we also collect something else: how people use the system.
    We can package these usage patterns and sell them to partners - companies, researchers,
    advertisers. No names. No profiles. But it\u2019s still our users\u2019 behavior."
  choiceA:
    label: Sell aggregated usage data
    flavor: We monetize insight.
    outcomeTitle: "New revenue streams open fast. Users don\u2019t notice - until
      they do."
    outcomeText: Additional revenue stabilizes the business and reduces pressure
      on core pricing. Data products are framed as anonymous and compliant, and partners
      integrate them quickly. Most users remain unaware of how their behavior is
      repurposed, until disclosures, leaks, or third-party uses make the practice
      visible. Trust weakens unevenly, not through outrage but through quiet reconsideration
      of how much the system is allowed to observe.

  choiceB:
    label: Keep user data internal
    flavor: "We don\u2019t sell behavior."
    outcomeTitle: Revenue stays simpler and slower. Pricing pressure increases elsewhere.
    outcomeText: "Revenue growth remains limited, and financial sustainability depends
      more heavily on users\u2019 willingness to pay. Pricing discussions become
      sharper, and access is shaped increasingly by cost rather than data extraction.
      Oversight remains clear, and data flows are easier to explain and defend. The
      system stays simpler, even as economic constraints begin to influence who can
      afford to use it."
