  title: Operational Changes
  bodyText: Our engineers are requesting changes to the system. They want to remove
    explainability layers from the decision loop. Each additional check adds latency.
    In combat systems, milliseconds matter. Delays cost lives.
  choiceA:
    label: Remove some safeguards
    flavor: Speed saves lives.
    outcomeTitle: The AI reacts faster. Later reviews become harder to conduct.
    outcomeText: System latency decreases, and response times improve in operational
      testing. Decisions become harder to reconstruct after the fact, as explainability
      layers are reduced or bypassed. Performance aligns more closely with military
      requirements, while post-incident analysis relies increasingly on trust in
      process rather than detailed traceability.
    effects:
      industry: 2
      civilSociety: 0
      governance: -1
      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Keep safeguards
    flavor: Safety first.
    outcomeTitle: The system remains auditable. The military marks it as "operationally
      limited."
    outcomeText: The system retains clear audit trails and interpretable decision
      paths. Review and accountability remain possible, even under pressure. Operational
      use is constrained, as latency and verification requirements limit deployment
      in time-critical contexts. The technology stays transparent, while its role
      in active operations remains restricted.

      civilSociety: 0
      governance: 2
      innovation: 0
