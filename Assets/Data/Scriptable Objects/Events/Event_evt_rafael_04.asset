  title: The Carbon Bill
  bodyText: "Our systems don\u2019t just consume electricity. They consume it at
    scale: data centers, cooling, redundancy. In some regions, that now includes
    carbon pricing. Every megawatt-hour has a cost and an emissions tag. We can keep
    operating the same way. Or we can reduce the most energy-intensive workloads.
    Either way, the bill doesn\u2019t go away."
  choiceA:
    label: Absorb the CO2 cost
    flavor: We treat it as operating expense.
    outcome: Development continues uninterrupted. Margins quietly shrink.
    effects:
      industry: -1
      civilSociety: 0
      governance: 0
      innovation: 1
  choiceB:
    label: Reduce energy-heavy workloads
    flavor: We cut where it hurts most.
    outcome: Emissions fall. Some teams lose their favorite models.
    effects:
      industry: 0
      civilSociety: 1
