  title: Onboarding Drop-Off
  bodyText: New users drop out early. The system feels overwhelming at first. We
    can simplify onboarding. Or keep all features visible.
  choiceA:
    label: Simplify onboarding
    flavor: We ease people in.
    outcomeTitle: New users stay longer. Advanced users feel constrained.
    outcomeText: The first-time experience is streamlined, showing only core functions
      and gradually unlocking more. Fewer users abandon the product in their first
      sessions, and adoption becomes smoother. Power users have to dig or wait to
      reach advanced tools. Growth broadens, while peak productivity arrives later.

      innovation: 1
  choiceB:
    label: Keep full functionality upfront
    flavor: "They\u2019ll figure it out."
    outcomeTitle: Experienced users are productive. Growth plateaus early.
    outcomeText: All features are visible from the start, letting experienced users
      work at full speed immediately. Newcomers face a steep learning curve and many
      never get past it. Usage remains intense among a smaller group, even as overall
      growth slows.
