  title: Surprise Update
  bodyText: "Did the AI change\u2026 or am I imagining things? It feels different.
    I just don\u2019t know how."
  choiceA:
    label: Add simple update notes
    flavor: We explain changes.
    outcomeTitle: Users feel oriented again. They also start paying attention.
    outcomeText: Users receive brief summaries of what changed and why. Expectations
      reset, and subtle shifts become easier to notice. People feel more grounded
      in how the system evolves, even as they begin to scrutinize its behavior more
      closely. Orientation improves, while complacency fades.

  choiceB:
    label: Keep updates invisible
    flavor: Seamless magic.
    outcomeTitle: Nothing breaks. Nothing is explained either.
    outcomeText: The system continues to update quietly in the background, preserving
      a smooth and uninterrupted experience. Performance improves without drawing
      attention to itself. At the same time, users are left guessing whether changes
      are real or imagined. Stability feels intact, even as understanding drifts.
