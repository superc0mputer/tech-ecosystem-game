  title: Confidently Wrong
  bodyText: "I like the AI. I really do. But it sounds confident in the same way
    people do right before they\u2019re wrong. When it\u2019s wrong, it doesn\u2019t
    sound wrong."
  choiceA:
    label: Tone down the confidence
    flavor: We add uncertainty.
    outcomeTitle: Users pause more often. They also trust themselves again.
    outcomeText: The system signals uncertainty more clearly, prompting users to
      slow down and verify key outputs. Workflows become more deliberate, with more
      human judgment in the loop. Some tasks take longer, but errors are caught earlier.
      The productivity of your system drops slightly, while the reliability of decisions
      improves.

  choiceB:
    label: Leave it as is
    flavor: Confidence sells.
    outcomeTitle: Decisions stay fast. Mistakes become harder to notice.
    outcomeText: Your system continues to deliver confident answers that integrate
      smoothly into fast-moving workflows. Users rely on it as a decisive reference,
      reducing friction and speeding up routine work. Mistakes slip through more
      easily, often discovered only after they have propagated. Efficiency of your
      system rises, while correction shifts from prevention to cleanup.
