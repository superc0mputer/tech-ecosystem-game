  title: The Feature Creep Question
  bodyText: "There\u2019s talk of cutting a feature because users might misuse it.
    Why would we do that? If potential misuse is the bar for removal, innovation
    doesn\u2019t get off the ground."
  choiceA:
    label: Keep the feature.
    flavor: "Choice is the user\u2019s."
    effects:
      industry: 0
      civilSociety: -1
      governance: -1
      innovation: 1
  choiceB:
    label: Remove it.
    flavor: We design with intent.
    effects:
      industry: 0
