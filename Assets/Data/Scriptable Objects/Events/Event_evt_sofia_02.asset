  title: The Cheap Content Wave
  bodyText: "Sofia forwards you drafts she didn\u2019t write herself. \"That\u2019s
    the draft for my next article: Studios are cutting freelance budgets. Not with
    layoffs. Just\u2026 fewer calls. They\u2019re using AI for drafts, concepts,
    sometimes finals. Just for efficiency. How do you want this written?\""
  choiceA:
    label: Emphasize AI as a support tool
    flavor: We talk augmentation, not replacement.
    outcome: The narrative softens. The market keeps cutting costs anyway.

  choiceB:
    label: Frame it as inevitable efficiency
    flavor: "We don\u2019t fight the trend."
    outcome: The story sounds realistic. Creative work looks increasingly disposable.
