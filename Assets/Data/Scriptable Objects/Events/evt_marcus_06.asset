  title: The Growth Shortcut
  bodyText: "We\u2019re stalling. Not because the product is bad - but because we\u2019re
    picky. There are markets asking for access now. Different languages. Different
    norms. Different risks. We can launch a lightweight version. Fewer checks. Less
    localization. Faster growth. It just\u2026 won\u2019t fit everywhere equally
    well."
  choiceA:
    label: Launch fast and wide
    flavor: Growth first. We'll fix later.
    outcomeTitle: User numbers spike across regions. Local friction quietly accumulates.
    outcomeText: User numbers rise quickly across new regions, driven by availability
      rather than suitability. The system works well enough to be adopted, but not
      well enough to reflect local norms, languages, or expectations. Minor issues
      accumulate without triggering immediate failure, handled through workarounds
      and informal guidance. Growth becomes visible long before alignment does, making
      later corrections slower and more politically costly.

  choiceB:
    label: Localize and adapt before launch
    flavor: We scale with care.
    outcomeTitle: Expansion is slower but steadier. Marcus checks his watch.
    outcomeText: Expansion progresses unevenly, shaped by research, translation,
      and local testing. Some opportunities are missed as competitors move faster,
      but early users encounter fewer mismatches and fewer silent failures. The system
      evolves through adaptation rather than correction. Growth remains restrained,
      while trust and long-term usability develop more consistently across regions.
