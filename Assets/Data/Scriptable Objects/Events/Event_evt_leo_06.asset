  title: The Exit Window
  bodyText: "We have an offer. Big one. A larger company wants to acquire us. They
    want our product and our speed. They\u2019ll keep building on your AI which we
    use for our product. That only works if your AI keeps powering it. If you support
    the transition, the deal closes fast and your technology becomes part of someone
    else\u2019s strategy. If you don\u2019t, they\u2019ll either walk \u2014 or rebuild
    without you."
  choiceA:
    label: Support the acquisition
    flavor: We stay inside the deal.
    effects: industry:2|innovation:1|governance:-2
    result: The product scales rapidly under new ownership. Your AI becomes harder
      to disentangle from external decisions.
  choiceB:
    label: Withhold deep cooperation
    flavor: "We don\u2019t follow every exit."
    effects: governance:2|civil_society:1|industry:-2
    result: The acquisition slows or reshapes. Your AI is replaced or reworked beyond
      your influence.
