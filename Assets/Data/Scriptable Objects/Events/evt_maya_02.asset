  title: Why This?
  bodyText: "Maya points at an AI suggestion. \"I\u2019m not saying that the proposal
    of your AI is wrong. I\u2019m saying I\u2019d like to know why it thinks this
    is a good idea.\""
  choiceA:
    label: Add short explanations
    flavor: Context matters.
    outcomeTitle: Understanding improves. So does the number of follow-up questions.
    outcomeText: "Each recommendation is paired with a brief rationale, giving users
      more context for what they see. People understand the system\u2019s reasoning
      better, but also spend more time questioning and discussing its outputs. Decisions
      slow as judgment becomes more collaborative. Transparency increases, while
      throughput decreases."

  choiceB:
    label: Keep it streamlined
    flavor: Speed is key.
    outcomeTitle: Workflows stay smooth. Agency quietly erodes.
    outcomeText: "Suggestions appear without added context, keeping interactions
      fast and uninterrupted. Users follow recommendations more readily, relying
      on the system\u2019s apparent confidence. Workflows stay efficient, even as
      the basis for decisions becomes less visible. Authority shifts quietly from
      human reasoning to automated output."
