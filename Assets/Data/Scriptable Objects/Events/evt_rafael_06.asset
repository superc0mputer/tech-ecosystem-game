  title: Who Pays the Infrastructure Cost?
  bodyText: "Data centers don\u2019t just use resources. They reshape local economies.
    Property prices near our sites have risen. Water and energy costs followed. Small
    businesses are being pushed out. We can contribute to local infrastructure. Or
    treat this as outside our responsibility. The market won\u2019t correct this
    on its own."
  choiceA:
    label: Co-invest in local infrastructure
    flavor: We offset our footprint.
    outcomeTitle: Local backlash softens. Expansion becomes more expensive.
    outcomeText: The company helps fund housing, utilities, and transport around
      its data centers. Pressure on local services eases, and relationships with
      municipalities improve. But these contributions raise the cost of every new
      site and slow the pace of expansion. Stability grows, while financial flexibility
      shrinks.

  choiceB:
    label: Externalize the costs
    flavor: We follow market rules.
    outcomeTitle: Margins stay strong. Social tension builds around your sites.
    outcomeText: The company limits its role to building and operating facilities,
      leaving surrounding impacts to the market and local governments. Investment
      and innovation continue without added constraints. As rents, prices, and resource
      strain rise, resentment around the sites increases. Growth stays strong, while
      social friction accumulates.
