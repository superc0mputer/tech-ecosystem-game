  title: Age Is Just a Setting
  bodyText: "Age gating exists, but the system doesn\u2019t behave differently. Same
    recommendation loops. Same nudges. Same feedback. If age matters only on paper,
    what does it protect?"
  choiceA:
    label: Limit certain features for younger users
    flavor: We reduce intensity.
    outcomeTitle: Youth exposure decreases. Product consistency breaks.
    outcomeText: Younger users encounter a more constrained version of the system,
      with fewer feedback loops and less aggressive engagement mechanics. Certain
      risks are reduced, but differences between age groups introduce complexity
      into design and maintenance. Product behavior becomes harder to unify, even
      as safeguards become more meaningful for those most affected.

      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Keep one experience for all users
    flavor: "We don\u2019t fragment the system."
    outcomeTitle: The platform stays simple. Protection remains symbolic.
    outcomeText: The platform remains technically uniform, and youth access is managed
      through age checks, moderation, and external controls. Younger users encounter
      the same engagement and recommendation dynamics as adults, relying on oversight
      rather than design differences for protection. Development stays streamlined,
      while the impact on minors depends on how consistently those safeguards are
      enforced.
