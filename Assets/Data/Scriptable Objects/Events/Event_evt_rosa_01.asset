  title: The Time Window
  bodyText: Appeals must be filed within seven days. Miss it, and the decision stands.
    Seven days is fine - if you have stability.
  choiceA:
    label: Extend appeal deadlines
    flavor: We account for reality.
    effects: civil_society:2|industry:-1
    result: More appeals are valid. Resolution slows.
  choiceB:
    label: Keep deadlines tight
    flavor: We need closure.
    effects: industry:2|civil_society:-1
    result: Processes stay predictable. Late appeals disappear.
