  title: What Kind of Company This Becomes
  bodyText: In ten years, this company will be one of two things. Either something
    others build on or something others replace. That depends on whether you design
    for long-term use or for fast iteration and replacement cycles. Both can be profitable.
  choiceA:
    label: Design for long-term dependence
    flavor: We become infrastructure.
    outcomeTitle: Customers rely on you deeply. Changing direction later becomes
      costly.
    outcomeText: Customers integrate the system deeply into their workflows, making
      it harder to replace over time. Stability and predictability become core expectations,
      shaping how changes are introduced and reviewed. Your company gains structural
      influence, but future shifts require careful coordination to avoid disruption.
      Long-term relevance strengthens, even as strategic freedom narrows.
    effects:
      industry: -1
      civilSociety: 0
      governance: 2
      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Design for flexibility and turnover
    flavor: We stay flexible.
    outcomeTitle: Adoption stays high. Long-term leverage remains uncertain.
    outcomeText: Adoption remains high as the system adapts quickly to new use cases
      and market signals. Customers expect regular change rather than permanence,
      and dependency stays limited. The company retains room to pivot, while long-term
      leverage depends on maintaining momentum rather than entrenchment. Growth continues,
      but durability remains an open question.

      governance: -1
      innovation: 0
