  title: Where to Build the Data Center
  bodyText: Site A runs mostly on solar. Energy is cheap and clean - but water is
    scarce. Cooling will compete with agriculture. Site B has abundant water and
    existing cooling infrastructure. But the grid relies heavily on coal and gas.
  choiceA:
    label: Build at the solar-powered site
    flavor: We optimize for clean energy.
    effects: governance:1|innovation:-1|industry:1
    result: Emissions stay low. Water usage becomes a bottleneck.
  choiceB:
    label: Build at the water-secure site
    flavor: We optimize for reliability and scale.
    effects: innovation:2|industry:1|governance:-1
    result: The system scales smoothly. Environmental scrutiny grows.
