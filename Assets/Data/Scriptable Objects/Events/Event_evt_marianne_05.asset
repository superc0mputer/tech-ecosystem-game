  title: The Safety Override
  bodyText: "A factory uses your AI to manage emergency shutdowns. It balances safety
    against unnecessary downtime. A sensor detected a risk. The system calculated
    it as low confidence and delayed the shutdown to avoid stopping the line. A worker
    was crushed. The system didn\u2019t malfunction. It optimized exactly as designed."
  choiceA:
    label: Accept liability for safety optimization
    flavor: "Efficiency can\u2019t outweigh life."
    effects: governance:2|civil_society:1|industry:-2
    result: Safety thresholds tighten. Automation loses flexibility.
  choiceB:
    label: Treat it as operational failure
    flavor: The system followed parameters.
    effects: industry:2|governance:-1|civil_society:-2
    result: Production continues. Workers trust systems less.
