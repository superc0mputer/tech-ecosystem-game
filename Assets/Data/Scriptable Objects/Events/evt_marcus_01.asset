  title: Just a Small Data Adjustment
  bodyText: "Retention could double if we\u2026 reinterpret user consent. Relax -
    everyone does it. We\u2019ll call it \u2018industry standard\u2019."
  choiceA:
    label: Do it.
    flavor: Growth first.
    outcomeTitle: Your KPIs explode. Somewhere, a privacy advocate refreshes Twitter.
    outcomeText: Consent becomes easier to obtain and harder to notice. Fewer users
      opt out, and engagement metrics improve across the board. Internally, the reinterpretation
      quickly becomes routine, referenced as standard practice rather than a deliberate
      choice. Outside the company, nothing visibly changes, but the gap between what
      users expect and what the system actually does widens. Growth accelerates,
      while trust erodes quietly, without triggering a clear moment of backlash.
    effects:
      industry: 1
      civilSociety: -1
      governance: 0
      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: No.
    flavor: We keep consent clean.
    outcomeTitle: "Marcus frowns. \"Ethics don\u2019t show up in revenue reports.\""
    outcomeText: The system asks more questions and moves more slowly. Some users
      disengage when faced with repeated consent prompts, and growth remains modest.
      Internally, teams adjust their ambitions, designing features that require less
      data or scale less aggressively. The system remains easier to defend and easier
      to explain, but its limits become more visible. Ethical clarity stabilizes
      trust, even as Marcus notes that the numbers fail to reflect it.
    effects:
      industry: 0
      civilSociety: 2
      governance: 0
      innovation: 0
