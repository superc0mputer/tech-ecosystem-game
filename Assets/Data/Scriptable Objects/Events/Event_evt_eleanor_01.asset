  title: Ringfencing the Risk
  bodyText: "One of your largest enterprise clients wants an indemnity clause. If
    your AI causes harm, you cover the downstream liability. It helps close the deal.
    It also means future incidents hit your balance sheet directly. This isn\u2019t
    about blame. It\u2019s about where risk lives."
  choiceA:
    label: Accept broader liability
    flavor: We absorb the risk to grow.
    outcome: The contract closes quickly. Your company becomes the default backstop
      when things go wrong.
    effects:
      industry: 2
      civilSociety: 0
      governance: -1
      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Limit liability
    flavor: "We don\u2019t underwrite unknown risk."
    outcome: Some deals fall through. Future exposure becomes easier to price and
      insure.
