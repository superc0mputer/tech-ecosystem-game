  title: The EU Audit
  bodyText: "The EU wants to audit our AI use. They\u2019re asking how decisions
    are made - and who oversees them. If they find violations, this won\u2019t stay
    a city problem."
  choiceA:
    label: Open the system to auditors
    flavor: We cooperate fully.
    outcomeTitle: The audit is slow and painful. Legitimacy improves.
    outcomeText: "Auditors gain access to data flows, models, and decision logs,
      extending the review process and exposing internal weaknesses. Fixes and clarifications
      slow day-to-day operations. At the same time, the city\u2019s use of AI becomes
      easier to defend in public and in law. Oversight deepens, while short-term
      flexibility declines."

  choiceB:
    label: Limit disclosure
    flavor: We provide summaries only.
    outcomeTitle: The city avoids immediate sanctions. Scrutiny intensifies.
    outcomeText: Only high-level documentation is provided, allowing the system to
      keep running without major interruption. Immediate penalties are avoided, but
      unanswered questions remain. Regulators begin to probe more aggressively, and
      trust erodes among watchdogs and the public. Momentum holds, while the cost
      of scrutiny rises.
