  title: The Rebound Effect
  bodyText: "Our efficiency work paid off. Energy per request is down. Costs dropped.
    Usage didn\u2019t just grow. It exploded. Because the system is cheaper and faster,
    people use it more. For things they wouldn\u2019t have used it for before. Total
    energy use is now higher than before the optimization. This is just what happens
    when something gets better."
  choiceA:
    label: Cap usage despite efficiency gains
    flavor: We limit growth deliberately.
    outcomeTitle: Total resource use stabilizes. Customers accuse you of artificial
      scarcity.
    outcomeText: Limits are placed on how much compute can be consumed, even though
      each request is now cheaper. Total energy and water use level off, and environmental
      targets become easier to meet. Customers who want to expand complain about
      constrained access and rising prices. Sustainability improves, while market
      growth is held back.

      innovation: 0
  choiceB:
    label: Let demand scale freely
    flavor: Efficiency justifies growth.
    outcomeTitle: Adoption surges. Infrastructure strain accelerates again.
    outcomeText: Lower costs and faster performance unlock new uses and a wave of
      additional demand. The platform becomes embedded in more products and workflows.
      Infrastructure and resource consumption climb again as overall volume rises.
      Growth accelerates, while environmental and regulatory pressure returns.
