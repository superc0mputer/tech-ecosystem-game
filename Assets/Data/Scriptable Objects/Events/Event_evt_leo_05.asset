  title: Too Fast to Regulate
  bodyText: "A copycat of our joint project just signed a high-visibility client.
    Public-facing. Politically sensitive. They\u2019re using the same underlying
    AI behavior. But without audits. Without guardrails. If this breaks, the technology
    - not the startup - takes the blame. We need to speed up."
  choiceA:
    label: Accelerate joint project
    flavor: We set the reference before others do.
    effects: innovation:2|industry:1|civil_society:-2
    result: Your implementation becomes the de facto standard. Public understanding
      lags behind real impact.
  choiceB:
    label: Publicly draw a hard line
    flavor: "We clarify what we will - and won\u2019t - support."
    effects: governance:2|civil_society:1|industry:-2
    result: Your position becomes defensible in hearings and audits. But the most
      visible deployments of your technology happen without you.
