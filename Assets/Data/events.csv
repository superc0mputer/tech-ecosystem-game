evt_marcus_05,Marcus Sterling,The Data Revenue Question,"Right now, our only income comes from the product. Subscriptions. Licenses. Usage fees. However, given the fierce competition, it is important to have additional financial resources. But we also collect something else: how people use the system.

Pricing pressure increases elsewhere."
evt_marcus_06,Marcus Sterling,The Growth Shortcut,"We’re stalling. Not because the product is bad - but because we’re picky. There are markets asking for access now. Different languages.

evt_eleanor_01,Eleanor Whitaker,Ringfencing the Risk,"One of your largest enterprise clients wants an indemnity clause. If your AI causes harm, you cover the downstream liability. It helps close the deal. It also means future incidents hit your balance sheet directly. This isn’t about blame. It’s about where risk lives.",Accept broader liability,We absorb the risk to grow.,"industry:2|governance:-1","The contract closes quickly. Your company becomes the default backstop when things go wrong.",Limit liability,We don’t underwrite unknown risk.,"governance:2|industry:-1","Some deals fall through.

You can’t talk about it — but you know it works.",Decline,,civil_society:2,"Voss nods. ""Then someone else will test theirs instead."""
evt_voss_02,Colonel Adrian Voss,The Secrecy Clause,"This clause in the contract means you cannot disclose how the AI is used, even to regulators or the public, without permission.

evt_leo_04,Leo Park,Your AI Our Product,"Our product is based entirely on your AI. When a user clicks a button, your model runs. On your servers. We didn’t build a fallback system.

They’ll keep building on your AI which we use for our product. That only works if your AI keeps powering it.

Or define it out of scope.",Design for misuse and misinterpretation,We assume real-world behavior.,"civil_society:1|governance:1|innovation:-1","The system tolerates mistakes better. Complexity and cost increase.",Limit responsibility to documented use,We certify intended operation.,"industry:2|governance:-1","Certification is straightforward. Harm outside assumptions becomes someone else’s problem."
evt_klaus_06,Dr. Klaus Weber,The First Casualty,"Your system was certified. Deployed according to guidelines. A downstream operator followed the manual. A decision was delayed. Someone died. This is the first real-world death linked to a certified system.",Suspend deployment and reopen certification,We treat this as a systemic failure.,"governance:1|civil_society:2|industry:-2","Trust in certification is rebuilt slowly. Your product becomes a warning case for the entire sector.",Treat it as operational misuse,We stand by the certification.,"industry:2|innovation:1|civil_society:-2","Deployment continues. Certification becomes a shield - not a guarantee."
evt_luis_01,Mayor Luis Hernández,City Hall on Fire,"The council meeting just ended. Badly. People are waiting months for building permits. The opposition is calling it ‘digital incompetence’. If your AI can cut the backlog this week, I can survive the next headline and in return I can help you with the next contract award.",Deploy immediately,The backlog ends.,"industry:2|governance:-1","Waiting times drop. Oversight is still catching up.",Wait for proper rollout,We check first.,"governance:2|industry:-1","The backlog shrinks slowly. The headlines don’t."
evt_luis_02,Mayor Luis Hernández,Budget Committee,"This AI would replace overtime hours in our call center. Fewer night shifts. Fewer temp contracts. But I can’t pay for every safeguard and audit you’re offering. Is there a version that just answers citizen emails automatically?",Offer a cheaper version,Savings first.,"industry:2","The city saves money. Some requests are mishandled.",Stick to full safeguards,Safety isn't optional.,"governance:2","Costs stay high. Automation is limited."
evt_luis_03,Mayor Luis Hernández,Unequal Service,"Luis puts a printed dashboard on the table. ""This AI sorts incoming requests for City Hall. In the city center, requests are answered within hours.

Overall processing slows down.",Optimize where it already works,Efficiency wins.,"industry:2|civil_society:-1","Central districts stay fast. Anger grows elsewhere."
evt_luis_04,Mayor Luis Hernández,Are We Using Citizen Data?,"Someone asked whether the AI learns from citizen records. Welfare history. Past complaints. Address data. If it learns from this, it predicts needs better. If it does, people think we’re profiling them.",Use local citizen data,It improves accuracy.,"industry:2|governance:-1","Predictions improve. Privacy fears rise.",Avoid local data,We don’t touch personal records.,"governance:2|industry:-1","Trust holds. The AI feels less helpful."
evt_luis_05,Mayor Luis Hernández,The Protest,"People are outside City Hall. They’re holding signs. The AI prioritizes service requests. Street repairs, housing complaints, welfare appointments. The system kept pushing one neighborhood down the list. Now they’re here. With cameras.",Suspend the AI immediately,We stop automated prioritization.,"civil_society:3|governance:1|industry:-1","The protest dissolves. Manual processing returns — slowly and expensively.",Defend the system publicly,The AI is neutral.,"industry:3|civil_society:-1","Efficiency holds. The protest becomes a political symbol."
evt_luis_06,Mayor Luis Hernández,The EU Audit,"The EU wants to audit our AI use. They’re asking how decisions are made - and who oversees them. If they find violations, this won’t stay a city problem.",Open the system to auditors,We cooperate fully.,"governance:3|civil_society:1|industry:-1","The audit is slow and painful. Legitimacy improves.",Limit disclosure,We provide summaries only.,"industry:3|governance:-1|civil_society:-1","The city avoids immediate sanctions. Scrutiny intensifies."
evt_luis_07,Mayor Luis Hernández,Targeted Visibility,"Our AI sends city notifications. Deadlines, service updates, reminders. It started prioritizing districts with low engagement. Turnout improves there. No one tells people who to vote for. But the timing helps me.",Standardize communication citywide,We make it strictly neutral.,"governance:2|civil_society:2|industry:-1","Messaging becomes neutral. Political advantages flatten out.",Keep optimizing engagement,It’s still public service.,"industry:2|governance:-1|civil_society:-1","Engagement rises where it matters. So do questions about fairness."
evt_luis_08,Mayor Luis Hernández,The Boundary,"The AI predicts which citizens respond to city services. Based on usage patterns.

Trust stabilizes.",Allow limited predictive use,We’re increasing participation.,"industry:2|governance:-1","Turnout shifts subtly. So does the meaning of neutrality."
evt_marianne_01,Justice Marianne Kovács,The Denied Appeal,"A citizen appealed a welfare decision. The agency used your AI to assess eligibility. The appeal failed because the agency couldn’t explain why the AI flagged the case as ineligible.

Your legal exposure grows.",Deny responsibility,The agency made the final call.,"industry:2|governance:-1","Your company is shielded. Legal clarity suffers."
evt_marianne_04,Justice Marianne Kovács,Unreadable Evidence,"This is from an active case. A citizen is suing a public agency over an automated decision. These are your system logs.

The case stalls anyway."
evt_marianne_05,Justice Marianne Kovács,The Safety Override,"A factory uses your AI to manage emergency shutdowns. It balances safety against unnecessary downtime. A sensor detected a risk.

evt_rafael_04,Rafael Ortiz,The Carbon Bill,"Our systems don’t just consume electricity. They consume it at scale: data centers, cooling, redundancy. In some regions, that now includes carbon pricing.
